1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,269
Another great race today,
Johnny.

2
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:47,573
Who are you gonna
ride in the Stakes?

3
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:50,128
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

4
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:52,590
and l live by it...

5
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:54,836
"Never change horses
in midstream."

6
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:59,061
Never change horses.
Sounds like a smart bet.

7
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,228
Always stick with a winner.

8
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:04,688
Keep America working.

9
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:08,429
Don't change horses
in midstream.

10
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:11,122
On election day,
reelect the president.

11
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,253
Can you step this way,
Mr. Brean?

12
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,011
Lift your arms, please.

13
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:33,362
That's him.
That's Mr. Fix-it.

14
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:47,825
lt's right here.

15
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:59,441
You have a seat here, Connie.

16
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:01,388
He doesn't know anything.

17
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:08,465
John Levy's staff,
his assistant...

18
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:10,477
and Amy Cain, Press.

19
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:18,225
Thank you.
That'll be all.

20
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:20,532
-Want some coffee?
-Black, please.

21
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,119
Gaviston, bring some coffee.
Black.

22
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:27,883
You kids in this room...

23
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:29,966
what you hear and say here...

24
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:32,559
if it gets out, you leaked it.

25
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:33,809
Tell them
what they need to know.

26
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,748
When it broke, the president
said, "Get me Conrad Brean."

27
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:40,785
What's the thing?

28
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:43,888
He had an illegal immigrant
nanny years back?

29
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:47,407
You get ahead in the polls,
suddenly you get nervous.

30
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:50,708
He made a pass
at some secretary years ago?

31
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:53,230
A group of Firefly Girls
were here last month.

32
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,659
One expressed interest
in a Frederic Remington bust.

33
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,419
They went in the office
behind the Oval Office.

34
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:00,909
lt couldn't have
been over three minutes.

35
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,925
The Secret Service
will confirm that.

36
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,275
lt's not the illegal
immigrant nanny thing?

37
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,280
The girl's alleging...

38
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,678
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

39
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:17,231
Maybe we could say it was
a drug reaction to the flu.

40
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,514
Who's got the story?

41
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,978
Don't you want to know
if it's true?

42
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,298
What's the difference?

43
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,668
lt's a story.
They'll run with it.

44
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,076
How long till it breaks?

45
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:27,019
Front page,
Washington Post, tomorrow.

46
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:29,167
That's not good.

47
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:32,172
-Where is he?
-China.

48
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:34,002
When is he due back?

49
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:36,721
They're set to leave soon.

50
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:41,969
He stays on the ground
in China at least another day.

51
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,860
Why?

52
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:45,323
You the Press Office?

53
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:46,959
Earn your money.
He's ill.

54
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:48,371
When do we bring him back?

55
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:50,958
l'm gonna need a day.

56
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:52,885
He's sick.
Get that out now.

57
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,957
Tell the jackals how sick he is.

58
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:57,867
We gotta get that out
before the story breaks.

59
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,145
lssue a bulletin.
He's got some rare strain--

60
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:02,930
-Won't hold.
-l need running time.

61
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,209
lt won't hold a day.

62
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:05,903
lt will.
l'll tell you why.

63
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:07,348
Why is the president in China?

64
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:09,585
-Trade relations.
-You're right.

65
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:11,825
lt's got nothing to do
with the B-3 bomber.

66
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:15,341
-There is no B-3 bomber.
-l just said that.

67
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,748
l don't know why
these rumors get started.

68
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:21,843
l need $20,000.
l need a car.

69
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:23,666
Get me a car and driver.

70
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:25,261
The southwest gate.

71
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,849
What?

72
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,153
What is it?

73
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:33,491
Campaign commercial.
Should we look at it?

74
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:36,372
Put it in.
This should be interesting.

75
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,706
What is it?

76
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:40,628
The other side's new commercial.

77
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,838
The Neal commercial.

78
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:43,764
We had somebody steal it.

79
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:46,546
This'll be on the air
the day after tomorrow.

80
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,298
ln the final days
of the campaign...

81
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,155
has the president
changed his tune?

82
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:54,353
Thank heaven for little girls.

83
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,625
The presidency is about honor.

84
00:05:56,661 --> 00:05:59,977
Thank heaven for little girls.

85
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,646
lt's about principles.

86
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,881
Without them,
what would little boys do?

87
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,372
lt's about integrity.

88
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:09,453
This tune has got to change.

89
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:14,348
On election day,
vote Neal for president.

90
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,519
Oh, boy.

91
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:19,945
Who's gonna take
the press conference today?

92
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:21,843
ls there a press conference
today?

93
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,120
What do you think?

94
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:25,906
We have to use this
as a base of operations.

95
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,948
l'm gonna need one, two days.

96
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,857
Whoever's leaking that stuff
to the Post lets it slip...

97
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,802
"l hope this won't
screw up the B-3 program."

98
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:37,041
"What B-3 program,
and why should it screw it up?"

99
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:39,149
"lf the president
deploys the B-3...

100
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:41,098
"before it's fully tested..."

101
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,474
"Deploy the B-3
before it's fully tested?"

102
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:45,515
"Why?"

103
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:46,898
"The crisis."

104
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:49,420
-What crisis?
-l'm working on that.

105
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,200
Get General Scott
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

106
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:54,992
and put them
on a plane to Seattle.

107
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,915
He's nervous to talk
to the Boeing people.

108
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,372
-But what?

109
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:00,907
There isn't a B-3 bomber.

110
00:07:00,948 --> 00:07:02,508
-Where'd you go to school?
-Dartmouth.

111
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,817
Then show a little spunk.
There is no B-3 bomber.

112
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:06,226
General Scott,
to your knowledge...

113
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,951
is not in Seattle
to talk to Boeing.

114
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:09,232
lt won't prove out.

115
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:12,529
lt doesn't have to prove out.
We just gotta distract them.

116
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:14,058
Got less than two weeks
till the election.

117
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,133
What in the world would do that?

118
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:18,317
l'm working on it.

119
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:26,481
Winifred, Mr. Brean.

120
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,784
-What's this?
-$20,000

121
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,755
l gotta go to L.A.
and see a Hollywood producer.

122
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:33,683
Meet me at National in an hour.

123
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,756
We'll go to Chicago
and connect there to L.A.

124
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:37,257
See you at National.

125
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:46,956
Tell me this again.

126
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:48,272
We landing?

127
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:51,017
Tell me again.

128
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:53,328
Don't worry.
lt's nothing new.

129
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:57,226
During Reagan's administration,
240 Marines killed in Beirut.

130
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,055
24 hours later,
we invade Grenada.

131
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:00,433
That was their M.O.

132
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,776
Change the story,
change the lead.

133
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:03,306
lt's not a new concept.

134
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,235
Wake me when we land.
We'll talk more.

135
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,438
Wait.
We can't afford a war.

136
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,384
We're not having a war.

137
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:10,922
We're having
the appearance of a war.

138
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:12,490
We cannot afford it.

139
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,346
-What'll it cost?
-But they would find out.

140
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,267
Who's gonna find out?
The American people?

141
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,209
Who's gonna tell them?

142
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:22,731
What did they find out
about the Gulf War?

143
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:25,226
One video of one bomb
falls down a chimney.

144
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,892
The building could have been
made out of Legos.

145
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:29,865
-You want us to go to war?
-That's the general idea.

146
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:33,133
With who?

147
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,698
l'm working on it.

148
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,188
Albania?

149
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:41,227
Why?

150
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,372
Why not?
What do you know about them?

151
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:45,549
-Nothing.
-Precisely.

152
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:48,205
They seem shifty, standoffish.

153
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:51,342
Who knows from Albania?
Who trusts Albanians?

154
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,234
What did Albania ever do to us?

155
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,281
What did they do for us?

156
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:57,072
This is why we have to
mobilize the B-3 bomber.

157
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:58,929
You really want to go
to war with Albania?

158
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:02,061
We don't have a choice.
This is what you do.

159
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:04,367
Get your press office
right now to deny it.

160
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:05,647
lt didn't happen.

161
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:08,366
"There is no report
of Albanian activity."

162
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:09,865
They have to deny it.

163
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:12,722
-lt didn't happen.
-Deny.

164
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:15,504
...news from the president
on his visit to China.

165
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:17,196
Another sort of news, however...

166
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:18,925
has emerged
from the presidential quarter.

167
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:21,832
We turn to Melissa Gardner
at KZAB in Santa Fe...

168
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,020
with this breaking news.

169
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:26,542
Thanks, Richard.
Today a local Firefly Girl...

170
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,229
accused the president
of sexual misconduct.

171
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,438
This photo of the president
with the girls...

172
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:34,409
was taken during their tour
of the White House.

173
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,392
The girl claims
that the sexual misconduct...

174
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:38,890
occurred inside the Oval Office.

175
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,905
Her attorney says
there are no plans yet...

176
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,287
to hold a press conference.

177
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,875
Folks in Santa Fe
and the rest of America...

178
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:46,987
are waiting for a response
from the White House...

179
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:49,001
on these harsh allegations.

180
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,620
With the election days away,
the big question is...

181
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,757
how much will this scandal
affect the outcome?

182
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:57,038
Top people, Albanian desk.

183
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,725
l don't know, either,
but we probably have one.

184
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:01,671
Roust them out of bed.

185
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:04,299
Albanian desk, ClA, NSA.
Roust them, sirens blaring.

186
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,378
l know they're gonna be up
in an hour.

187
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,360
l want them up now.
Tell your staff...

188
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:09,646
General Scott in Seattle?

189
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:13,937
l don't think his trip
has to do with the B-3 bomber.

190
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,174
l'll have to ask you
to turn that off.

191
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,098
lt'll just be a second.

192
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,985
There are no electronics
on the plane.

193
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:22,058
l have to ask you
to turn that off.

194
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,472
lt'll just take two seconds.

195
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:26,223
We've said flat out
there is no B-3 bomber.

196
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,981
l understand.

197
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,334
lf it is true, he should,
he must step down...

198
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:34,574
and if it's not true,
then he must...

199
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,577
We are informed he has extended
his visit to China.

200
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:40,618
l say on behalf of
the American people, come home.

201
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:43,407
Face the music,
whatever that may be.

202
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,871
The election's in 11 days.

203
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:47,018
Let the American people decide.

204
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,464
"Let the American people
decide."

205
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:51,181
Senator Neal,
presidential candidate.

206
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,712
Excuse me, Senator...

207
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,608
That's 11 days
till the election...

208
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:57,097
and the president
ahead in the polls by--Bob?

209
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:58,512
Seventeen percent.

210
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:02,440
Accusations have surfaced which
could affect the outcome...

211
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:03,791
The White House has announced...

212
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,516
in response
to the media pressure...

213
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,277
there will be
a press conference.

214
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:09,452
This is how
a Hollywood producer lives?

215
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:11,911
This is bigger
than the White House.

216
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,396
Get me my veggie shake...

217
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,768
and remind me
to turn over in 10 minutes...

218
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,103
to tan the other side.

219
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,821
Do l know you?

220
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:26,246
We have mutual friends
in Washington.

221
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,551
Yes, as you said,
and is it true?

222
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:31,494
Mr. Motss, l wouldn't--

223
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:34,221
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't true.

224
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:37,869
Really, who could say?

225
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,393
l like the guy.
He signed his book to me...

226
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,433
"For two generations--"
What was it?

227
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:46,025
"For progress to occur,"
l think he said.

228
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,999
Two Generations to Agree, yes.

229
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,950
That's what he inscribed.
How'd you know that?

230
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:52,270
That's the title of the book.

231
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:53,582
That's the title?

232
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:57,706
For Progress to Occur
lt's Necessary for Two--

233
00:11:57,745 --> 00:11:59,119
That's a terrible title.

234
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:03,785
You're right.

235
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:06,575
For Two Generations to Agree.
That is the title.

236
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,169
l never looked at the cover.

237
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,136
l just looked
at what he wrote to me.

238
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,274
When you get the time,
read the cover.

239
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:14,476
John Levy is expected to respond
to the allegations...

240
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,105
of sexual misconduct
by the president.

241
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:18,759
This guy is fucked.

242
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:25,797
What one has to do, Mr. Motss,
is fight a holding action.

243
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:28,459
They'll run this man
through the shredder.

244
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:31,278
lf we hold the break
in the dam till the election...

245
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:32,589
we got a chance.

246
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,829
You can't hold the dam.

247
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:37,003
l don't get
what you want me to do.

248
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:42,540
...advised him to stay
in China for one or two days.

249
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:45,391
During that time,
of course, we'll remain--

250
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,311
But he's gotta
come back sometime.

251
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,133
What is one or two days
gonna buy you?

252
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,728
Look at all those hands.

253
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,362
Brer Rabbit
couldn't get out of this.

254
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,604
Would you comment please
on the rumors...

255
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,542
that the president's delay...

256
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:59,592
is due to the situation
in Albania?

257
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,951
There is...

258
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,359
l'm not aware of the situation
to which you refer.

259
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:07,301
We've just learned
that the State Department...

260
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:10,639
has set up a special Albanian
task force at Ops Center.

261
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:14,731
Mr. Sklansky, l am--We have--
Mrs. Rose?

262
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:18,478
Early this morning,
General Scott flew to Seattle.

263
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:21,578
ls his trip connected
with the B-3 bomber?

264
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:26,405
To the best of my knowledge,
there is no B-3 bomber.

265
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:29,350
Mr. Levy, is the situation
in Albania related...

266
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,781
to the Muslim fundamentalist
anti-American uprising?

267
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:34,377
Now they get it.

268
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,318
There you go.
There's a little help.

269
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,971
...that have
fundamentalist movements...

270
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:43,015
How close are you to this?

271
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,845
What do you want the kid to say?

272
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:51,179
We will keep you apprised
of any new information.

273
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:54,631
At this time,
there is no information...

274
00:13:54,672 --> 00:13:57,487
Have him say...

275
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,334
l know we're all concerned
for the president.

276
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:04,361
l'm sure that our hopes
and prayers are with him.

277
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,221
Could you have Levy say...

278
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:08,165
"l know we're all concerned
for the president.

279
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,614
"l'm sure our hopes
and prayers are with him."

280
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:16,653
l want to say l know we are all
concerned for the president...

281
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:19,054
and our hopes and prayers
are with him.

282
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,265
He didn't phrase it right.

283
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:21,764
He didn't sell the line.

284
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,979
You bought yourself one day,
maybe two.

285
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:30,404
All l need
is 11 till the election.

286
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:32,749
This isn't gonna hold
for 11 days.

287
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:34,823
-The guy fucked a Girl Scout.
-A Firefly Girl.

288
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:37,001
He fucked a Firefly Girl.

289
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,308
What are you gonna do
to hold that off?

290
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,969
l'm gonna get my veggie shake.

291
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:42,382
What do you think
would hold it off?

292
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,528
Nothing.

293
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,815
You'd have to have a war.

294
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,837
You're kidding.
You're not kidding.

295
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,527
l'm in show business.
Why come to me?

296
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,880
l'll tell you why.

297
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,504
"54, 40, or fight."
What does that mean?

298
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:08,452
-lt's a slogan.
-"Remember the Maine."

299
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,181
"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too."

300
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,029
They're war slogans.

301
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:16,484
We remember the slogans,
not the wars.

302
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:17,836
You know why?

303
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,758
That's show business.
That's why we're here.

304
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,929
Naked girl, covered in napalm.

305
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,243
"V" for victory.

306
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,213
5 Marines raising the flag,
Mount Surabachi.

307
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,479
You remember the picture
in 50 years, but forget the war.

308
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,137
The Gulf War, smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

309
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:34,280
2,500 missions a day, 100 days.

310
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:36,490
One video of one bomb.

311
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,185
The American people
bought that war.

312
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:41,070
War is show business.
That's why we're here.

313
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:43,590
What do you do
for the president?

314
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:46,060
Why Albania?

315
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:47,655
Why not?

316
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:49,320
They gotta know at some point.

317
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:50,471
Who?

318
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:55,181
The public.

319
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:56,621
They gotta know?

320
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,597
Get with it.
Who killed Kennedy?

321
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:00,710
l read the first draft
of the Warren Report.

322
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,790
Says he was killed
by a drunk driver.

323
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,001
The Gulf War.
What do you see day after day?

324
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,013
The one smart bomb
falling down a chimney.

325
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,265
The truth?

326
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,441
l was in the building
when we shot that shot.

327
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:12,366
We shot it in a studio
in Falls Church, Virginia.

328
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:13,707
1/10 scale model of a building.

329
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:14,919
ls that true?

330
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,845
How do we know?
You take my point?

331
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:18,471
All right.

332
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,779
You want me to do what?

333
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,123
To produce.

334
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:24,646
You want me to produce your war?

335
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:26,475
Not a war.
lt's a pageant.

336
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,965
We need a theme,
a song, some visuals.

337
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:30,347
lt's a pageant.

338
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:32,357
lt's like the Oscars.
That's why we came to you.

339
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,023
l never won an Oscar.

340
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,298
That's a shame,
but you produced the Oscars.

341
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,894
lndeed, l did.

342
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:40,171
You're a writer,
that's your script.

343
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:42,378
You're a director,
but if you're the producer...

344
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:44,934
nobody knows what you do.

345
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:46,762
The producer,
all he's got is the credit.

346
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,132
You see?
And some plaques on the wall.

347
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,980
They don't know what we do.
Don't get me started.

348
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,730
lf you never won an Oscar...

349
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,292
how would you like
an ambassadorship?

350
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,017
An ambassadorship?
That's my payoff?

351
00:16:59,054 --> 00:17:00,614
Tell me what you want.

352
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:03,337
l'd just do it
for a story to tell.

353
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:04,748
You couldn't tell anybody.

354
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:06,854
l'm just kidding.

355
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,381
-You couldn't tell anybody.
-Just a figure of speech.

356
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:11,690
lt's a pageant.

357
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:12,903
That's what it is.

358
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:14,152
The country's at war.

359
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,367
lt's Miss America.
You're Bert Parks.

360
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:17,162
-Why Albania?
-Because.

361
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:19,652
What do we have
that they want?

362
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,603
-Freedom.
-Why would they want that?

363
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:24,907
-Oppressed?
-Fuck freedom.

364
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:28,072
They want to destroy
the godless Satan.

365
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,214
They want to destroy
our way of life.

366
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:31,464
All right?

367
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:34,501
The president is in China.

368
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,388
He is dealing with the dispatch
of the B-3 bomber to Albania.

369
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:40,486
Why?

370
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,107
Why? Help me.

371
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,877
Geo-politically...

372
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:51,783
We found out they have the bomb.

373
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:59,721
-That's good.
-And...wait a second.

374
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,207
The bomb's not there...

375
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:06,212
because they'd have to have
a rocket and that shit.

376
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,319
They are a bunch of wogs.
Cross that out.

377
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,364
lt's a suitcase bomb.

378
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,260
l didn't know l said that.

379
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,660
lt's a suitcase bomb.
You don't need missiles.

380
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,449
You can put a bomb
in a suitcase.

381
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:22,082
That's good.
A suitcase bomb.

382
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:23,466
lt's a suitcase bomb.

383
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:26,763
When it's cooking, it's cooking.

384
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:28,837
We're cooking, and it's in...

385
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:33,221
Canada. All right?

386
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:35,716
Albanian terrorists
have placed a suitcase bomb...

387
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:39,783
in Canada in an attempt
to infiltrate it into the USA.

388
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,984
-That's good.
-That's terrific.

389
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,159
l'll tell you why.
lt is cost effective.

390
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:47,368
lt's producing.
That's what it is.

391
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:49,892
-lt's really great.
-l could tell you stories.

392
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,136
Cecil B. De Mille,
The Greatest Show on Earth...

393
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,060
he needs an elephant.

394
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:55,270
l got the president on the line.

395
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:57,989
One minute.

396
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:02,438
Needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Know what he does?

397
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:04,811
Ames here. Yes, sir?

398
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,732
You listening?

399
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:08,772
-Nobody's listening.
-l'm listening.

400
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,976
-The suitcase bomb.
-Good title for a movie.

401
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:13,987
Please, write it down.
Don't editorialize.

402
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,265
The thinking is, terrorism.

403
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,616
Act One:
Albania denies everything.

404
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,759
The president comes on the air,
"Be calm."

405
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:24,040
Know what l need?

406
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:27,688
Get me Johnny Dean,
Liz Butsky, and the Fad King.

407
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,153
lsn't Johnny Dean in the...

408
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:32,358
Back in Nashville.

409
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,809
-Act Two.
-We don't need an Act Two.

410
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:38,535
Don't forget Fad King.
We don't need an Act Two?

411
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:40,481
We just have to hold
their interest for 11 days.

412
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:42,412
lt's a teaser.

413
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:44,037
Absolutely right.

414
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:46,978
Grace. Teaser.

415
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,605
They're getting a good reaction
on the Albanian thing.

416
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,643
Hello, John, you two-bit
redneck shitkicker.

417
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:54,375
How the heck are you?

418
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:56,299
Get out.

419
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:01,802
He's got a new wife.

420
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:05,447
He's riding in a pickup truck
with a shotgun and a dog.

421
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:11,938
We need you here yesterday.

422
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,176
All right?
Get your ass out here.

423
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:17,578
The president wonders about
the possible Albanian backlash.

424
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:20,033
You can't have a war
without an enemy.

425
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:22,345
We could, but it would be dull.

426
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:23,808
How long do we need him?

427
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,542
We're done in 11 days.

428
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,751
Eleven days. We need you.

429
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:30,209
You want to write a song for us?

430
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:31,943
ls there gonna be a back end?

431
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,859
ls there a back end?

432
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,615
Back end?

433
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,539
Percentage points, money.

434
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,000
Count on it.

435
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:42,694
Where is the back end
coming from?

436
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:45,317
lt's like
that yellow ribbon thing.

437
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,941
The hostages.

438
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,249
They tied the yellow ribbons
around everything.

439
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,105
But that was
a naturally occurring--

440
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:53,284
That was a put-up job?

441
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,946
l want you to get Johnny
a ticket.

442
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:04,482
Fad King on two.

443
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:07,370
He's riding in a pickup truck
with a shotgun and a dog.

444
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,277
Are you shitting me?

445
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:14,058
King, got a thing here,
product placement.

446
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:15,301
Of course there's a back end.

447
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:19,622
-lt can't be a ribbon.
-What's wrong with a ribbon?

448
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:21,481
AlDS has
the yellow ribbon thing.

449
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:22,725
Fuck ribbons.

450
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:24,388
Canada.
Our neighbor to the north...

451
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:27,045
all of a sudden transformed
into that place from whence...

452
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,156
like the north wind,
terror comes.

453
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:30,602
l like that. Keep talking.

454
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,260
What guards us against Canada?

455
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:35,615
l guard the Canadian border.

456
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,088
Mounties guard the border.
Mountie hats.

457
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:38,505
Stupid fucking hats.

458
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:39,880
Davy Crockett had a hat.

459
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:42,915
You could crush them
and put them in your pocket.

460
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:45,410
You can't put a mountie hat
in your pocket.

461
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,003
You see this?
This is what producing is.

462
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:52,036
You put me in a room
with talent...electric.

463
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,700
l'm thinking armbands.

464
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:57,961
-Armbands is good.
-l'm thinking green.

465
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:00,842
Last year, the number one color
in new cars was green.

466
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,947
-People like green.
-Hunter.

467
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:05,856
Hunter green.
Strong, pride, dignity.

468
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:07,687
Not Kelly green.

469
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,827
l like it with a hat.

470
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,776
-Maybe.
-You see that?

471
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:17,671
Sit on my lap if you love me...

472
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:20,489
but don't put your hand
down there.

473
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:21,831
l didn't mean--

474
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:24,549
We'll take a short nap.

475
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,725
l thought you should see it.

476
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,137
lt shouldn't be a song.

477
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,262
l'm glad that your mama's
not here.

478
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:33,825
Don't do a song about it.

479
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,044
l thought it was funny.

480
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:36,326
Sit on my lap...

481
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:39,810
l don't think it's appropriate
for what we're doing.

482
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,712
l just meant for you to see it.

483
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:44,936
l guard the Canadian border.

484
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,141
The president spent the weekend
pressing the flesh.

485
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:49,120
He wasn't campaigning.
He was dating, actually.

486
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:55,463
Change this. Thank you.

487
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:58,248
Behind the mention of Albania,
of his stomach flu...

488
00:22:58,282 --> 00:23:01,282
taking refuge these scant days
away from the election.

489
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:03,328
Young girl in rubble.

490
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,403
She was driven from her home
by Albanian terrorists.

491
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:09,092
lt is her
we are mobilizing to defend.

492
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,912
-Or is it she?
-lt is her.

493
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:13,374
Can we get her a kitten?

494
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:15,687
Young girl in rubble
with a kitten.

495
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:16,932
That's good.

496
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,036
This is too static.

497
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:22,561
Young girl running
from the village.

498
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,812
More energy.

499
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,217
Time to face
these terrible charges...

500
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:29,413
to answer
all of these questions.

501
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,392
-What's this?
-Head shots.

502
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:35,973
Girls to play the victim
in our news footage.

503
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:37,220
Write this down.

504
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:39,559
Young girl running
from village towards camera.

505
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:42,179
Grainy hand-held news footage.

506
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:43,494
Send it to everyone.

507
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,660
What do you think?
l like the sorrowful one.

508
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:48,769
What is this again?

509
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,679
Young Albanian girl
running from her home.

510
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,932
l like this broad here.

511
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:55,554
Where? Too Texan.

512
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:57,251
We're locked into Albania.
Why?

513
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:58,566
Albania's hard to rhyme.

514
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:01,055
What are you looking at me for?

515
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:02,438
lt's the name of the country.

516
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,704
That rhymes.

517
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,642
-John Belushi?
-Jim.

518
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:14,055
Jim Belushi.

519
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:16,227
-Jim Belushi what?
-Albanian?

520
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:17,988
Jim Belushi's Albanian?

521
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,334
Are you kidding?

522
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,566
Know anybody who's eaten
in an Albanian restaurant?

523
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:25,219
-ls there such a thing?
-Has to be.

524
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,835
-ls there a national dish?
-We can make it up.

525
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:30,596
Jim Belushi is Albanian.

526
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:47,941
What time is it?

527
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:50,882
3:03.

528
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,131
Great idea.

529
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:55,551
To the men and women of
the 303 detachment with their...

530
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,022
Leopard skin.

531
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:59,007
With their berets.

532
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,423
How about all black?

533
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,344
That's good.

534
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,719
Half black, half leopard...

535
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,825
wear it on your head.

536
00:25:05,865 --> 00:25:08,647
Half black, half leopard...

537
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:11,136
wear it to your bed.

538
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,380
Half black, half leopard.

539
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:15,489
l guard...

540
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:18,599
the American dream.

541
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:22,209
l guard...

542
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:25,983
the American dream.

543
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:36,740
Everybody's always
in a hurry these days.

544
00:25:36,776 --> 00:25:38,686
lf they're not
rushing somewhere...

545
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:41,216
they're changing something
that doesn't need changing.

546
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:44,518
That's why l'm glad
we're behind the president.

547
00:25:44,552 --> 00:25:47,847
Sure we are.
lt just makes good sense.

548
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,214
You don't want to change
horses in midstream.

549
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,484
Why are they sticking
with this age-old horseshit?

550
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,691
Why are they sticking
with the same garbage?

551
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:57,762
-Who hires these people?
-l feel insulted having seen it.

552
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,767
-lt's offensive.
-Poorly costumed.

553
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:04,321
New York Times,
Washington Post: war.

554
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,295
Times got the Firefly Girl
in the Style section.

555
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:09,987
Post on page 12.

556
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:12,096
lt's good. Hello?

557
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,046
lt's very important. Listen up.

558
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,244
lt's all war.
You're doing good.

559
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,832
Would you vote for that person
based on that commercial?

560
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,977
-l don't vote.
-Why don't you vote?

561
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:25,220
When Major League Baseball
started the fans voting...

562
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:26,630
l voted for Boog Powell
on first base.

563
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:28,867
He didn't get in,
and it disappointed me.

564
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,114
lt's futile.

565
00:26:30,151 --> 00:26:32,039
You've never voted
for president?

566
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:34,209
Do you vote?

567
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:36,865
No. l always vote
for the Academy Awards...

568
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:38,180
but l never win.

569
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:39,393
Liz, do you vote?

570
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,887
l don't vote.
l don't like the rooms.

571
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,131
Too claustrophobic.
l can't vote in small places.

572
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,756
lt's about that time.

573
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:59,558
We got the Albanian girl
with a cat, a kitten, and a dog.

574
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:01,664
l don't want a dog.
l asked for a kitten.

575
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,638
l understand that,
but the pet wrangler suggested--

576
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,679
l need to speak to the president
before you pick an animal.

577
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:10,948
Can't they find me a kitten?
Listen to me.

578
00:27:10,983 --> 00:27:13,187
Albanian terrorists
have a staging area...

579
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:15,776
for their atomic workshop.
That's why she's fleeing.

580
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:17,823
What if it wasn't Albania?
Say it was ltaly?

581
00:27:17,863 --> 00:27:20,514
l can get a lot of cash
if it's ltaly.

582
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,617
"Give them the boot."
What if a shoe was the fad?

583
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:26,557
The little girl
is coming toward the camera.

584
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,119
What does she have in her hands?
A kitten.

585
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,014
Albania doesn't
do anything for me.

586
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:32,388
That's the problem.

587
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:34,790
-We're locked into Albania.
-Why is that?

588
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:39,012
The president's going to war
in about 30 minutes.

589
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:40,454
Declaring war on Albania?

590
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:42,559
We're not declaring war.
We're going to war.

591
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,836
We haven't declared war
since World War ll.

592
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,278
We're going to war.

593
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:52,798
This late-breaking news
just in from Air Force One.

594
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,213
The president
of the United States...

595
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:57,508
has said he apologizes
for the need for secrecy...

596
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,615
and he assures
that it is necessary...

597
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:02,273
for the safety of the men
and women in combat.

598
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,383
He says that
the Republic of Albania...

599
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:08,001
long a staging ground
for terrorism around the world.

600
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,813
He mentioned a state of war
is or is about to happen...

601
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:14,629
between the United States
and the Republic of Albania.

602
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:16,133
How many kittens do we have?

603
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,370
There ought to be
kittens a-plenty. l called.

604
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:21,858
People, let's get started.

605
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:27,011
My name is Stanley Motss.
l'll be your producer.

606
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:29,054
What l would like you to do,
Miss--

607
00:28:29,094 --> 00:28:30,272
Tracy Lime.

608
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,481
Stand against that wall,
and on my signal...

609
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,723
l want you running toward me,
screaming.

610
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:36,765
-Can we get you anything?
-l'm fine.

611
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:39,676
How about a cup of tea?
A little milk, low fat?

612
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,896
You OK?

613
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,974
Fine. Let's try one.

614
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,251
ls this a national?
ls that the case?

615
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,261
lt's a direct buy-out.

616
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:49,636
Have your agent--
What is this?

617
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,492
What is this, a menagerie?

618
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:53,947
l can't wait to put this
on my resume.

619
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,707
Can l talk to you for a minute?

620
00:28:56,742 --> 00:28:58,367
This is a special kind
of situation.

621
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:03,013
We have a schnauzer
and what appears to be--

622
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,158
lt's a Lhasa apso.

623
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:07,100
lt couldn't have been simpler.
Kittens.

624
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:11,102
What you got here
is a cross between a dog--

625
00:29:11,142 --> 00:29:12,833
l just want kittens.

626
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,292
Absolutely, sir.
The president wants a kitten.

627
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,341
l want a kitten.

628
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,382
Get rid of the dogs
and keep the kittens.

629
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:21,828
Miss. Excuse me.

630
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:24,480
l have to have you sign
this sheet of paper.

631
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:27,005
My agent would be miffed
with me if l--

632
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:28,736
This doesn't have to do
with your deal.

633
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:30,716
This is your security clearance.

634
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,280
Right there.

635
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:37,027
Nice signature. Thank you.

636
00:29:37,062 --> 00:29:38,403
Nice meeting you.

637
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,056
This is a nice one.

638
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:46,752
That's a cat.
These are kittens.

639
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,383
They wanted to give options.

640
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:52,251
lt's too confusing.
He's pushing the Lopso opso.

641
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:54,268
-We'll do it optically.
-Digitally.

642
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,317
Let's try to shoot one.

643
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:57,983
-Stacey--
-Tracy.

644
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:00,388
l want you to stand over here.

645
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:02,625
Here you go. Right there.

646
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:03,937
These are chips.

647
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:08,864
Hold the bag when you run.

648
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:10,756
lt's for the arm position.
On screen, it'll be a kitten.

649
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,197
Can l hold the kitten?

650
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,636
We'll punch it in later.

651
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,328
You're gonna punch
the kitten later?

652
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:16,543
Why?

653
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,272
For a wider set of options.

654
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:20,578
A wider option of what?

655
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:22,239
Of kittens.

656
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:28,195
Sir, all kidding aside,
l get to put it on my resume?

657
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:29,755
Actually, no.

658
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:33,058
What is it,
a guild thing or something?

659
00:30:33,093 --> 00:30:35,329
You can never tell anyone
you did this.

660
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:36,609
What could they do?

661
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,979
They'd come to your house
and kill you.

662
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,053
The president.

663
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:43,198
Stop the makeup.
She's been raped by terrorists.

664
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:45,059
-She's not pale enough.
-Jump out.

665
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,362
They're starting to shoot now...

666
00:30:47,397 --> 00:30:50,397
and they're gonna
do the kitten thing optically.

667
00:30:50,437 --> 00:30:52,095
That's right, Mr. President.

668
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,987
l don't know how
they do the kitten optically...

669
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,876
but they know
what they're doing.

670
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,561
She's not an illegal immigrant,
is she?

671
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:03,774
Could l see the contract?

672
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,569
Why is it so flat?

673
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:08,954
Because the president cannot
employ an illegal immigrant.

674
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,720
-Let's use more spray.
-Cover up.

675
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:12,513
Let's keep working!

676
00:31:12,548 --> 00:31:14,010
Are we getting there?

677
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:20,673
Good.
Put the village behind her.

678
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:30,851
Gimme some flames.

679
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:35,521
How about some screaming?

680
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:36,800
Screaming's good.

681
00:31:36,837 --> 00:31:38,692
Some sound of screaming.

682
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,664
What might be good
is ooh-ahh sirens.

683
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,610
You know. Anne Frank.

684
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,626
That's good.

685
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:51,523
Find us the Anne Frank sirens.

686
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:53,312
That's chilling. That's good.

687
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:54,755
That's giving me goose bumps.

688
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:57,241
Find us the ooh-ahhs.

689
00:32:03,812 --> 00:32:05,885
We're gonna be back
in Washington when?

690
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,386
We'll be back tonight.

691
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:09,021
Tonight is...

692
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,875
lt seems that Senator Neal
has discovered something.

693
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:14,363
lt makes no difference
about Senator Neal.

694
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:17,055
l don't care what he's got.
We got a war.

695
00:32:19,076 --> 00:32:20,702
Look at that girl.

696
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,169
Doesn't she look Albanian?

697
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:24,600
She looks like she was
born and raised in Albania.

698
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:28,322
l got an instinct for casting.
Don't ask me why.

699
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:30,211
We're gonna do it again,
sweetie.

700
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:32,383
-What's her name, Stacey?
-Tracy.

701
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,591
One more time.
You're doing fine.

702
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:39,138
Could she be running
across a bridge?

703
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:43,418
She's running across
a burning bridge.

704
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:52,701
-That looks good.
-That's beautiful.

705
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:54,463
Of course,
we'll need some water.

706
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:56,222
ls it a stream?

707
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,569
l think...

708
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,873
-A pond?
-l think...

709
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:02,329
l think it's a calico kitten.

710
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:04,827
She's running across
with a kitten.

711
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:07,201
Can we have a calico kitten?
Please?

712
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,755
Floyd, punch in a calico kitten.

713
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,356
l have 19 screens here.

714
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:13,086
l can't see one calico kitten.

715
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:16,669
The thinking is
a small calico kitten, sir.

716
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,922
We have a small calico kitten.

717
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:30,720
-What?
-He wants a white one.

718
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:32,610
He wants a white one?

719
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,672
Let me talk to him.

720
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:37,603
He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.

721
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:39,359
Can l talk to him?

722
00:33:39,395 --> 00:33:41,086
He's mobilizing the sixth fleet.

723
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,474
l hate it
when they start to meddle.

724
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:46,914
Can we have a white one?

725
00:33:46,947 --> 00:33:48,256
He wants a white one.

726
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:53,183
Thank you.

727
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,284
Are we ready yet?

728
00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:07,193
How soon can we get this cut?

729
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:08,860
4 or 5 hours.

730
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:11,714
That's good.
We can leak that to the press...

731
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:14,169
they can downlink it
on Tel star 401, transporter 21.

732
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:17,753
Makes you glad
you've lived this long.

733
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:23,545
This just in--a special report
from the Albanian front.

734
00:34:23,586 --> 00:34:24,895
We've just received
information...

735
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:28,062
the young Albanian national
fleeing in this video...

736
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,921
is attempting to escape
terrorist reprisals...

737
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:31,165
in her village.

738
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:37,912
America has seldom witnessed...

739
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:39,994
a more poignant picture
of the human race...

740
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:41,977
Fantastic.

741
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:43,611
They used the same process...

742
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,211
with the last
Schwarzenegger movie.

743
00:34:46,563 --> 00:34:48,188
lsn't that amazing
how they do that?

744
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:50,463
This is only the beginning.

745
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:52,157
Wait till we get the song.

746
00:34:52,194 --> 00:34:54,780
Then you got the song, image,
merchandising tie-ins.

747
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:56,095
This is only the beginning.

748
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,032
We were right.
You're the man.

749
00:34:59,074 --> 00:35:01,049
To the beginning.

750
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,497
Got your car.

751
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,115
l hate it
when they send these long ones.

752
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:07,576
-Did you make the turn OK?
-Not a problem.

753
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:09,658
l'm sorry.
You think it's too ostentatious?

754
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:11,040
Just fine. l'll stretch out.

755
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:12,350
Good. Just make due.

756
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:15,233
l'll see you in Nashville.

757
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,483
Go with the two-tone hat.

758
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:21,889
l don't care.
You work it out.

759
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:24,956
You. You must have had
similar situations in the past.

760
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:28,540
There are unconfirmed reports
from a reliable source...

761
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:30,334
that things are in motion.

762
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,825
What l'm hearing--
and this is a quote--

763
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:34,688
"The president
is looking for a swift...

764
00:35:34,722 --> 00:35:36,925
"painless, and victorious
conclusion to the war."

765
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:39,929
However, the source
will not go on record.

766
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:42,969
All l can tell you is this
comes from the highest level.

767
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:44,765
New York Times,
Washington Post...

768
00:35:44,802 --> 00:35:46,078
Detroit Register,
Sacramento Bee...

769
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:48,983
all in remission.
No mention of the Firefly Girl.

770
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:51,513
10 days to go.
Big Bird lands when?

771
00:35:51,553 --> 00:35:53,015
Five a.m.

772
00:35:53,057 --> 00:35:54,301
Anything at the airport?

773
00:35:54,338 --> 00:35:55,996
The press thought no.
What do you think?

774
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,943
Here's what l think.
ls it gonna rain?

775
00:35:57,986 --> 00:35:59,644
Can you give me the weather
tomorrow morning?

776
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:01,110
Andrews, five a.m.

777
00:36:01,153 --> 00:36:03,128
A young Albanian girl...

778
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:04,860
dressed in her...whatever.

779
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:08,280
ls there
some harvest festival...

780
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:10,558
an Albanian harvest festival,
something like that?

781
00:36:10,593 --> 00:36:12,732
Find me
an Albanian harvest festival.

782
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:14,013
There's gotta be something.

783
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,089
Anyway, she gives him
the sacred whatever it is...

784
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,780
telling him this is a sacred
traditional offering...

785
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:21,185
given to the man
who ties the first sheaf...

786
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:23,257
the last sheaf,
who knows what sheaf?

787
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:24,639
ls she saying this in Albanian?

788
00:36:24,674 --> 00:36:25,917
She's speaking in Albanian...

789
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,124
because this is the only way
it can be understood...

790
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:30,715
by her sacred, sainted,
and aged mother...

791
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:33,568
We're picking them up now.

792
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:36,700
The old lady starts to speak.

793
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,526
"You have brought peace
not only to this--"

794
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:40,830
The child speaks.

795
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,654
A face of innocence,
no cynicism.

796
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:43,933
The child says...

797
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,530
Are you getting this?

798
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:48,220
The old broad starts to cry.

799
00:36:48,257 --> 00:36:50,144
Big Bird shrugs off
his secret service,...

800
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:52,217
covers her with his coat,
end of story.

801
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:55,902
Can you find out if we could
get some rain tomorrow?

802
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,693
How is Big Bird holding up?

803
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:58,906
He's good.

804
00:36:58,945 --> 00:37:01,814
He does want to know--
what does Motss want?

805
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:04,279
l don't know.
Ambassador to Togo.

806
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:07,485
No rain tomorrow at Andrews,
but there's rain at Boca Raton.

807
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:09,409
Then direct the plane to Boca.

808
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:11,580
Connie says
divert the plane to Boca.

809
00:37:18,177 --> 00:37:19,387
What's happening?

810
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,950
Can l help you?

811
00:37:36,992 --> 00:37:38,269
What's the problem?

812
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,886
We're in a rush.

813
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,099
Do you know who we are?

814
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,925
l'm afraid that's the trouble,
Miss Ames.

815
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:46,652
ClA.

816
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:55,384
l have this to say...

817
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:06,966
...every American man,
woman, and child...

818
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:08,601
What am l gonna do?

819
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,015
l have
a three-year-old daughter...

820
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:11,804
eventually headed
for orthodonture.

821
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,557
Now that the ClA knows,
l'm gonna lose everything--

822
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,697
my career, my reputation.
What am l gonna do?

823
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:18,624
Brazen it through.

824
00:38:18,656 --> 00:38:20,314
Took you long enough.

825
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:22,359
We found them
as soon as we could.

826
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,189
All right.

827
00:38:24,224 --> 00:38:27,072
After l'm done with them,
what do they want me to do?

828
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,406
Lug them back to the district
or dump them in the country...

829
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,869
let the FBl trip over them?

830
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,821
Legal department says you pick.

831
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:34,359
Depends on what we want
to do with them.

832
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,083
This is a special report
on the war in Albania.

833
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,646
We've just received
more details...

834
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:40,575
on the Albanian girl
running for her life.

835
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:42,168
The young girl
was trying to escape...

836
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,096
after hearing
her family was killed.

837
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:46,430
Apparently, there was
a family connection in Canada.

838
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:52,214
Two things l know to be true...

839
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:56,158
there's no difference between
good flan and bad flan...

840
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:57,653
and there is no war.

841
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:58,939
Guess who l am.

842
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:01,845
l would like to point out
that l am under medical care...

843
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,222
and taking medication,
side effects of which have--

844
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:05,848
Quite touching.

845
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:07,481
l also take this opportunity...

846
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,105
to suggest that, equally,
l admit to nothing...

847
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:11,638
and l would like
my lawyer present.

848
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,534
We show, and NSA confirms...

849
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:16,317
there are no nuclear devices
on the Canadian border.

850
00:39:16,352 --> 00:39:18,490
There are no nuclear devices
in Albania.

851
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,437
Albania has no nuclear capacity.

852
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:22,072
Our spy satellites...

853
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,184
show no secret
terrorist training camps...

854
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:26,078
in the Albanian hinterland.

855
00:39:26,112 --> 00:39:28,959
The border patrol, the FBl,
the RCMP report...

856
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:32,472
no--repeat--
no untoward activity...

857
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:34,715
along our picturesque
Canadian border.

858
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:37,621
The Albanian government
is screaming its defense.

859
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:38,907
The world is listening.

860
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:40,318
There is no war.

861
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:42,773
There's a war.
l'm watching it on television.

862
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,725
Who might you be?

863
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:47,254
-Conrad Brean.
-Who do you work for?

864
00:39:47,295 --> 00:39:50,556
Nobody whose name
you want me to say.

865
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:53,526
lt's all well, but when the fit
hits the shan...

866
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,094
somebody has to stay
after school.

867
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:56,564
Who might that be?

868
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:58,843
l don't know
what you're talking about.

869
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:01,246
The spy satellites show it.

870
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:02,523
They show no war.

871
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,020
Then what good are they?

872
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:07,260
Why spend a quarter trillion
dollars a year on defense?

873
00:40:07,295 --> 00:40:08,670
What good are they?

874
00:40:08,703 --> 00:40:10,077
Are they useless or just broken?

875
00:40:10,111 --> 00:40:11,900
l would like
to point out further...

876
00:40:11,935 --> 00:40:13,724
that these medications
taken in conjunction--

877
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:16,312
lf there's no threat,
then where are you?

878
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,911
lf there's no threat,
what good are you?

879
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:20,056
You are the threat.

880
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:21,436
l'm the threat?

881
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:22,845
What have l been doing
the last 30 years...

882
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,788
that you haven't been doing?

883
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:26,587
The last 30 years...

884
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:28,477
l have been working to ensure
the security of my country.

885
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:31,446
l'm sure that speaks well
of you and your parents...

886
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:33,723
but if forced to choose between
the security of your country...

887
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,930
and the security of your job,
which would you pick?

888
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,454
While you hesitate,
permit me to suggest...

889
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:40,731
that they are one in the same.

890
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:43,155
l'm doing my job.
That's what you see me doing.

891
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,725
l'm doing my job, too.

892
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:45,944
The constant stress
l am under...

893
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:48,765
Let me ask you
a simple question.

894
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:51,035
Why do people go to war?

895
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,492
l'll play your silly game.

896
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,744
To ensure their way of life.

897
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:56,692

-Would you fight to do that?
-l have.

898
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:59,320
lf you went to war again,
who would it be against?

899
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:01,497
Your ability to fight
a two-ocean war against who?

900
00:41:01,534 --> 00:41:02,712
Sweden and Togo?

901
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,758
That time has passed.
lt's over.

902
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:07,450
The war of the future
is nuclear terrorism.

903
00:41:07,486 --> 00:41:09,341
lt'll be against
a small group of dissidents...

904
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:12,342
who, unbeknownst perhaps to
their own governments, have...

905
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:14,487
To go to that war,
you have to be prepared.

906
00:41:14,526 --> 00:41:16,915
You gotta be alert.
The public has gotta be alert...

907
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:19,063
because that is the war
of the future...

908
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,753
and if you're not gearing up
to fight that war...

909
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,830
then the ax will fall.
You'll be out in the street.

910
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,837
You can call this a drill,
call this job security...

911
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:29,213
call it anything you like,
but l got one for you.

912
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:30,839
Go to war
to preserve your way of life?

913
00:41:30,878 --> 00:41:34,042
Chuck, this is your way of life.

914
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,965
lf your spy satellites
don't see nothing...

915
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:37,525
if there ain't no war...

916
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:40,413
then you can go home
and take up golf...

917
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:42,421
'cause there ain't no war
but ours.

918
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:47,929
Thank you.

919
00:41:49,054 --> 00:41:50,581
Drive carefully.

920
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:00,215
Nice enough people.

921
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:01,781
They just hadn't
thought it through.

922
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,578
You talked us out of there.

923
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,686
We got delayed.
We're going to Nashville.

924
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:06,904
What?

925
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,665
You could talk a dog
off a meat truck.

926
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:10,524
Thank you.

927
00:42:10,558 --> 00:42:11,932
We just got stuck.

928
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:14,551
All systems five-by-five.
See you in Nashville.

929
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:16,116
You saved our bacon.

930
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:18,296
lt was just a...

931
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,603
a phenomenal performance.

932
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,165
You turned them around.

933
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,236
They hadn't thought it through.

934
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,006
He's moving across the tarmac.

935
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,957
But it appears something
has distracted the president...

936
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:42,386
and he has stopped moving
toward the waiting motorcade.

937
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,153
There's a little girl...

938
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:45,978
trying to speak
to the president.

939
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:47,769
lt seems she's speaking in--

940
00:42:47,805 --> 00:42:49,234
ls it Albanian?

941
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:50,968
Can we get someone
to translate?

942
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:54,456
Dan,
l think what she is saying...

943
00:42:54,493 --> 00:42:58,290
is that this wheat offering
is sort of ceremonial...

944
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,788
and that it is
the first sheaf...

945
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,455
the first cut of the harvest.

946
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:04,402
l'm not proficient
in Albanian...

947
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:06,005
but the old woman
is quite taken...

948
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:08,217
as the president
is offering her the coat.

949
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,773
lt is quite
an emotional moment here.

950
00:43:10,813 --> 00:43:13,049
There comes a time...

951
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:17,081
in the course of human events...

952
00:43:17,757 --> 00:43:20,408
when a threat
must be answered...

953
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:23,065
with courage and strength.

954
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:27,474
Our forefathers earned...

955
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:29,851
the right to be free.

956
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:32,438
Now it's time...

957
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:36,307
to guard their dream.

958
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:39,316
We guard...

959
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:43,351
our American borders.

960
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:45,723
We guard...

961
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:48,790
the American dream.

962
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:51,382
We guard our right...

963
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:56,156
to fight for democracy...

964
00:43:56,188 --> 00:44:01,458
and keep our country free.

965
00:44:02,237 --> 00:44:05,171
We guard...

966
00:44:05,213 --> 00:44:07,733
our American spirit.

967
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:11,543
We guard...

968
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:14,264
the American dream.

969
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,639
Our country's built...

970
00:44:28,572 --> 00:44:30,644
on the rock of liberty.

971
00:44:31,804 --> 00:44:34,651
And we, as people...

972
00:44:34,684 --> 00:44:36,789
must keep it free.

973
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:39,763
lt is for life...

974
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:41,048
liberty...

975
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:44,150
the pursuit of happiness...

976
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:49,108
Freedom, 'tis of thee.

977
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:53,048
We guard...

978
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:56,978
our American borders.

979
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,354
We guard...

980
00:44:59,388 --> 00:45:02,236
the American dream.

981
00:45:03,356 --> 00:45:05,243
l loved the fat,
wet Albanian broad.

982
00:45:05,276 --> 00:45:06,520
Thank you.

983
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:08,247
You know why?
lt was understated.

984
00:45:08,283 --> 00:45:09,941
You got lucky
with the rain, too.

985
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,216
We had to divert
the plane to Boca Raton.

986
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:14,488
You should have come to me.
We have rain machines.

987
00:45:14,524 --> 00:45:15,800
l'm a producer. l make rain.

988
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:17,177
Next time.

989
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:19,761
l have just gotten word...

990
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:23,000
that the situation
in Albania is resolved...

991
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:25,207
that it is resolved.

992
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:26,869
The ClA confirms...

993
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:29,755
that our troops
along the Canadian border...

994
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:32,406
and overseas are standing down.

995
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:37,522
l must take this opportunity
to call upon our president...

996
00:45:37,564 --> 00:45:39,571
What does he mean,
the situation has been resolved?

997
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,204
He just ended the war.

998
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:42,454
He ended the war?

999
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:43,865
Why did he do that?

1000
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,361
l think the ClA
cut a better deal.

1001
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:46,614
He ended the war?

1002
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,800
He can't end the war.

1003
00:45:50,843 --> 00:45:52,785
He's not producing this.

1004
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:57,813
This is in bad taste.

1005
00:45:57,851 --> 00:45:59,127
Can we stop this?

1006
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,345
Stop. lt's over.

1007
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:06,290
Can we stop this?

1008
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:07,761
Stop the choir.

1009
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:11,382
lt has been quite a week,
Richard.

1010
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:13,656
l can't remember
when any president...

1011
00:46:13,691 --> 00:46:15,382
was hit with the flu, a war...

1012
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:17,907
and accused of sexual
misconduct by a teenage girl...

1013
00:46:17,947 --> 00:46:19,322
all in the same
seven-day period.

1014
00:46:19,355 --> 00:46:22,901
This, of course, only days
before he runs for reelection.

1015
00:46:22,939 --> 00:46:25,208
We've just received information
from sources at the ClA...

1016
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:28,276
that confirms the cessation
of hostilities...

1017
00:46:28,315 --> 00:46:29,526
The ClA.

1018
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:34,490
l thought they let us out
too easily.

1019
00:46:34,523 --> 00:46:36,312
The war's over.

1020
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:38,289
lt's over.
l saw it on television.

1021
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:39,541
l have to sell my house.

1022
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:42,579
The war is not over.

1023
00:46:42,618 --> 00:46:43,927
l saw it on TV.

1024
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:46,614
That's what you hired me for.

1025
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:48,985
The war isn't over
until l say it's over.

1026
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:51,353
This is my picture.
This is not the ClA's picture.

1027
00:46:51,387 --> 00:46:54,234
You think
you're in a tight spot now?

1028
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:56,918
Try making The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

1029
00:46:56,955 --> 00:46:58,842
Three of the horsemen died.

1030
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,558
Hear what he's saying?
Three of the horsemen died...

1031
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:03,733
two weeks before the end
of principal photography.

1032
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:05,942
This is nothing.

1033
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:09,044
This is just Act One,
"The War."

1034
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,880
We really do need an Act Two,
so we work.

1035
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:14,101
Act Two.

1036
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:15,448
You know what it's like?

1037
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:17,108
The Japanese. ln the caves.

1038
00:47:17,146 --> 00:47:19,154
-Go on.
-Okinawa.

1039
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:21,050
They didn't believe
the war was over.

1040
00:47:21,082 --> 00:47:23,090
We have a guy
who doesn't believe--

1041
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,171
We have an American serviceman.

1042
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,959
A brave American serviceman
is left behind.

1043
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:30,099
A hero.

1044
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,310
l can't believe it.
What was l thinking?

1045
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:34,037
We had a war.
We forgot the hero.

1046
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:36,791
You can't have a war
and not have a hero.

1047
00:47:36,827 --> 00:47:38,136
lt's like we sent
a Christmas card...

1048
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:39,664
and left out the--
What do you call it?

1049
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:40,950
-Fruitcake.
-There you go.

1050
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,873
Let's work.

1051
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:44,913
We got a guy
who's left behind, so--

1052
00:47:44,954 --> 00:47:47,442
This is terrific.
This is lucky this happened.

1053
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:49,370
He was left behind,
just discarded...

1054
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:52,468
like an old shoe.

1055
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:53,684
That's good.

1056
00:47:53,722 --> 00:47:55,380
What's good? What did l say?

1057
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:56,596
-Shoe.
-Old shoe?

1058
00:47:56,634 --> 00:47:57,845
lt's just instinct.

1059
00:47:59,674 --> 00:48:01,779
Get me the Pentagon...

1060
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:05,298
a list of people in all
military special programs.

1061
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:07,280
"Left behind like an old shoe."
That is good.

1062
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:10,297
l want to talk to Johnny.

1063
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,028
What is it?

1064
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:17,848
The war is over.

1065
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:20,053
We're going to need a new song.

1066
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:22,708
lt should be a song
about a shiny shoe...

1067
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:25,201
a black patent shoe...

1068
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:26,965
a good old shoe.

1069
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:29,652
l was on my way to get drunk.

1070
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:33,650
You get drunk, but l need
a good old shoe song.

1071
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,064
A ballad of loss...

1072
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,615
-Want to help me?
-Redemption.

1073
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,367
Loss and redemption
is very good.

1074
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:44,467
Shit.
What key do you want it in?

1075
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,912
l don't know keys.

1076
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:50,710
People here are depressed
because the war just ended.

1077
00:48:50,746 --> 00:48:52,786
Please give me a new song.

1078
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:54,548
l got him.

1079
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:56,626
King, Pentagon.

1080
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:58,127
Take it.

1081
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,650
l need a list
of military special programs.

1082
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,991
Bottom of the ninth.

1083
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:05,432
They don't know
who they're playing with.

1084
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:08,943
They don't shut down
our picture.

1085
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:10,742
You people gonna be long?

1086
00:49:10,777 --> 00:49:12,599
Otherwise,
l'll put away the equipment.

1087
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:13,811
l don't know what l'm doing.

1088
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:16,500
l think l'm supposed
to be writing a song.

1089
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,911
What kind of song?

1090
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:20,181
ls there anybody there named...

1091
00:49:20,217 --> 00:49:22,072
Schumann?

1092
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:24,309
-Schuster?
-Schumacher.

1093
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:25,556
l got a great idea.

1094
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:29,080
Old shoe, new shoe.

1095
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:32,751
Daddy had a hound dog...

1096
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:35,859
used to call him Blue.

1097
00:49:38,553 --> 00:49:41,106
Follow me 'round...

1098
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,600
stick to me like glue.

1099
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:50,263
His favorite thing
to play with...

1100
00:49:50,297 --> 00:49:52,272
used to be a good ol' shoe.

1101
00:49:52,313 --> 00:49:54,287
Wait a minute.
Used to be.

1102
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:55,954
You hit that 16-16.

1103
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,902
Well, l wish l had a woman...

1104
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:01,072
who was half as good and true.

1105
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,349
Anybody here know Morse code?

1106
00:50:06,392 --> 00:50:07,669
What you gonna do?

1107
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:08,981
Give me the fax.

1108
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:12,024
Sergeant William Schumann,
U.S. Army...

1109
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:15,831
serial number 2131284262.

1110
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:18,422
Good ol' shoe...

1111
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:19,667
Here's the deal.

1112
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:22,807
Good Ol' Shoe.

1113
00:50:25,048 --> 00:50:26,641
Whatever you walk in...

1114
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:28,207
he will get you through.

1115
00:50:28,249 --> 00:50:31,118
He's in a sweater...

1116
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,687
and he's...

1117
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:35,598
We drop him behind enemy lines.

1118
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,134
He's trapped.

1119
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:38,551
The sweater.

1120
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:40,307
-ln the sweater.
-Good.

1121
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:46,199
ls there a way we can make it
sound old and scratchy...

1122
00:50:46,232 --> 00:50:47,858
with, like, a hiss?

1123
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:54,036
With an old label.

1124
00:50:54,072 --> 00:50:55,479
l see where you're going.

1125
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,025
Stand up straight and tall...

1126
00:51:03,064 --> 00:51:04,853
the way he taught you to.

1127
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:06,579
l'll write a speech.

1128
00:51:08,216 --> 00:51:10,223
l'll help you with the speech.

1129
00:51:10,264 --> 00:51:13,013
The president reveals
that William Schumann...

1130
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,421
was trapped behind enemy lines.

1131
00:51:18,456 --> 00:51:20,311
This is good.

1132
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:22,068
Heartfelt.

1133
00:51:22,104 --> 00:51:23,314
Touching.

1134
00:51:24,568 --> 00:51:25,778
People will weep.

1135
00:51:26,904 --> 00:51:29,392
Soul of a good ol' shoe.

1136
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:34,195
He might even get to heaven...

1137
00:51:34,232 --> 00:51:37,166
on the soul of his good ol'...

1138
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,761
shoe.

1139
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:46,062
Here's the president's speech.

1140
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,046
Put this
in the Library of Congress.

1141
00:51:48,088 --> 00:51:49,713
Folk music section, 1930.

1142
00:51:49,752 --> 00:51:51,607
Right away, please.

1143
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:54,257
Get it in
the Library of Congress now.

1144
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:58,067
Oh, God.

1145
00:51:58,103 --> 00:52:00,013
Who's seeing
the CBS guy tonight?

1146
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:04,371
Tonight, you remember some song
from the folk song days--

1147
00:52:04,408 --> 00:52:05,717
about a good old shoe.

1148
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:07,028
Tonight?

1149
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:09,681
You're with him watching
the president's speech--

1150
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:10,929
What if he's busy?

1151
00:52:10,968 --> 00:52:13,553
-Lure him.
-What are you saying?

1152
00:52:13,591 --> 00:52:16,625
l don't have to be
your confessor, darling.

1153
00:52:16,663 --> 00:52:19,118
Tell him you've got info
on the sex scandal...

1154
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,403
it's on your conscience.

1155
00:52:20,439 --> 00:52:22,195
He'll drop whatever he's doing.

1156
00:52:23,383 --> 00:52:24,877
This is a shitty business.

1157
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,992
lt needs no ghost from the grave
to tell us that...

1158
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:29,366
but, Lord willing,
eight days from now...

1159
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,985
l'm gonna take you
into the second term.

1160
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,365
Wait till you hear the speech.

1161
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:35,254
The 303 speech. Great.

1162
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:37,010
Where's that Fad King?

1163
00:52:37,047 --> 00:52:38,225
l'll get him.

1164
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:39,540
Could we go now?

1165
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:41,910
A good plan today is better
than a perfect plan tomorrow.

1166
00:52:41,943 --> 00:52:44,147
How are they doing
on Sergeant Schumann?

1167
00:52:44,183 --> 00:52:45,906
They're working on him,
they're finding him.

1168
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:47,470
Good. lt's working.

1169
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,933
lt's all happening.
lt's taking place around us.

1170
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:53,521
lt is in the works.
lt is being addressed.

1171
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:54,803
We are being proactive.

1172
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,872
We are going out with what
may be the finest example--

1173
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:00,529
Get me an update on the army,
the Pentagon.

1174
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:02,028
Get this guy Schumann.

1175
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:03,380
Have him standing by.

1176
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:07,441
l gotta tell you,
l see a lot of glum faces.

1177
00:53:07,478 --> 00:53:08,940
Please don't be disconsolate.

1178
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:12,114
This is politics at its finest.

1179
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:15,085
This is where the rubber
meets the road.

1180
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:17,265
We've got a leader
going out tonight...

1181
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:18,896
to 95 million American homes.

1182
00:53:18,935 --> 00:53:20,593
He's gonna turn
this thing around.

1183
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,321
You think this is tough?

1184
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:25,108
l was 4 months into production
on The Song of Solomon...

1185
00:53:25,143 --> 00:53:26,637
found out l didn't
have the rights.

1186
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:28,205
Turn it up. lt's our spot.

1187
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,345
Tough? This is nothing.

1188
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:34,481
Will you look at that shit?

1189
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:37,908
'Cause you don't change
horses in midstream.

1190
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:42,517
Don't change horses.

1191
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,892
This speech is good.

1192
00:53:43,926 --> 00:53:46,031
We're kinda locked into it,
Mr. President.

1193
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:49,646
For the future
of our families...

1194
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:51,726
The music.
Where did they get that?

1195
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:57,779
-Pain in the ass.
-What?

1196
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:02,293
He won't do the speech.

1197
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,301
What do you mean?

1198
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:06,098
What choice does he have?

1199
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:08,021
He won't do the speech?

1200
00:54:08,054 --> 00:54:09,428
He says it's corny.

1201
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:11,666
lt's what? lt's corny?

1202
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:14,130
Of course it's corny.

1203
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,719
We wouldn't have him say it
if it wasn't.

1204
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:18,132
lt's not a question.

1205
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,824
This is the center
for rest of the thing.

1206
00:54:19,862 --> 00:54:21,040
Don't tell me it's corny.

1207
00:54:21,078 --> 00:54:23,413
We're locked into the speech,
right?

1208
00:54:23,446 --> 00:54:24,624
We're locked in.

1209
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:26,484
We are playing way past this.

1210
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:27,794
We are past this.

1211
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,118
This is what l need.

1212
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:34,638
Get me 30 secretaries
and put them in an office now.

1213
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,548
l need to see the president.

1214
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,346
l need 5 minutes.

1215
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:41,236
Know what this reminds me of?

1216
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:44,204
Years ago, when l first
went out to Hollywood...

1217
00:54:44,246 --> 00:54:45,423
they said,
"lt's too theatrical."

1218
00:54:45,462 --> 00:54:48,429
l was from the theater.
Everything was over their heads.

1219
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:49,747
He thinks it's corny.

1220
00:54:49,782 --> 00:54:51,375
Don't tell me it's corny.

1221
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,820
Tell him l'm comin'.

1222
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:56,716
My fellow Americans,
l thank a merciful God...

1223
00:54:56,757 --> 00:54:59,408
and l am sure
each and every one of us...

1224
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:01,300
will thank that Supreme Power...

1225
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:04,432
whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1226
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,859
that peace is at hand.

1227
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:10,415
The threat of nuclear terrorism
has been quelled.

1228
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:13,486
Mr. President, l'm using
a little more projection...

1229
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:17,006
because l think this speech
needs a little umph.

1230
00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:20,049
Bear with me.

1231
00:55:21,493 --> 00:55:23,020
Beautiful.

1232
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,550
Thank you so much.

1233
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:39,534
That was so moving.

1234
00:55:39,573 --> 00:55:40,817
Thank you so much.

1235
00:55:40,853 --> 00:55:42,064
Thank you.

1236
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,184
l felt very much at home
in there.

1237
00:55:51,221 --> 00:55:52,748
Simple quirk of fate.

1238
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:54,284
l could have gone this way.

1239
00:55:54,325 --> 00:55:55,667
lt's all a change in wardrobe.

1240
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:58,196
Was it too much?

1241
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:01,098
l'll tell you.

1242
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:02,351
You did it.

1243
00:56:03,381 --> 00:56:04,625
You jumped in there...

1244
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,450
and saved the thing
when the thing needed saving.

1245
00:56:06,484 --> 00:56:08,394
lt wasn't too much?

1246
00:56:08,437 --> 00:56:10,193
Personally?

1247
00:56:10,228 --> 00:56:11,406
Maybe it was.

1248
00:56:11,445 --> 00:56:14,543
The president doesn't
have to say it that way.

1249
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:15,987
lt's like Plato once said.

1250
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:17,581
lt doesn't matter
how you get there...

1251
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:18,831
as long as you get there.

1252
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:20,079
He said that?

1253
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:22,321
What is it exactly
you do for the president?

1254
00:56:22,356 --> 00:56:25,324
My fellow Americans,
l thank a merciful God...

1255
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:29,140
and l'm sure all of us
will thank that Supreme Power...

1256
00:56:29,172 --> 00:56:31,758
whatever we conceive
that power to be...

1257
00:56:31,796 --> 00:56:34,251
that peace is at hand.

1258
00:56:38,805 --> 00:56:41,488
The threat of nuclear terrorism
has been quelled.

1259
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:44,873
We are in contact
with the Albanian premier...

1260
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,324
who assures me--

1261
00:56:46,356 --> 00:56:48,495
and this government
credits his assurances--

1262
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:50,921
his country
does not wish us ill...

1263
00:56:50,964 --> 00:56:52,142
Know any Latin?

1264
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,674
l, Claudius.
That's what l know.

1265
00:56:53,717 --> 00:56:57,164
l need a Latin motto
for the patch.

1266
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,765
The 303 patch.

1267
00:56:58,804 --> 00:57:02,317
...but by
a designation number, 303.

1268
00:57:02,357 --> 00:57:06,415
A member was left behind
what were then enemy lines.

1269
00:57:06,453 --> 00:57:10,446
l can only say to those
family members of Group 303...

1270
00:57:10,484 --> 00:57:13,070
whose members are,
l know as l speak...

1271
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:14,450
gathering to comfort you.

1272
00:57:14,484 --> 00:57:16,851
To the parents
of the missing man...

1273
00:57:16,884 --> 00:57:18,640
no effort will be spared...

1274
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:22,157
to find this brave man
and bring him home.

1275
00:57:22,196 --> 00:57:25,491
We've just received
this photograph of Schumann...

1276
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:28,491
held by a dissident group
of Albanian terrorists.

1277
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:31,532
l don't know how many of you
know Morse code...

1278
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:34,441
but could you
bring the camera closer?

1279
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:38,379
You'll see his sweater is worn.

1280
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,787
lt has been unraveled in places.

1281
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:42,478
Those places
form dashes and dots...

1282
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:47,120
and those dots spell out
a message in Morse code.

1283
00:57:47,156 --> 00:57:49,774
That message is, "Courage, Mom."

1284
00:57:52,148 --> 00:57:53,554
He got the message through.

1285
00:57:55,444 --> 00:57:57,266
Not bad for government work.

1286
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:58,925
Having a good time?

1287
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:01,135
Haven't had this much fun
since live TV.

1288
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:03,725
To the men and women
of Unit 303...

1289
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:06,130
to my fellow citizens,
l say, "Courage, Mom."

1290
00:58:06,164 --> 00:58:09,961
l have informed Albania
that we will not rest...

1291
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:11,760
until the safe return
of Sergeant Schumann.

1292
00:58:11,795 --> 00:58:15,821
l'm told his unit mates gave him
the nickname "Old Shoe."

1293
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:19,722
Wasn't there a folk song
called "Old Shoe?"

1294
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:22,731
Do you remember that?
Something like...

1295
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:25,641
l don't know.
l can vaguely remember it.

1296
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:27,822
Do you know
what l'm talking about?

1297
00:58:30,035 --> 00:58:31,628
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1298
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:33,642
Good night and God bless.

1299
00:58:33,683 --> 00:58:37,906
Trump that, Senator Neal,
you Howdy-Doody-looking vontz.

1300
00:58:37,939 --> 00:58:40,787
As we reported earlier, U.S.
Serviceman Willie Schumann...

1301
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:42,477
remains missing behind
enemy lines...

1302
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:44,784
lt's all thinking ahead.

1303
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:46,248
That's what producing is.

1304
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:47,721
lt's like being a plumber.

1305
00:58:49,491 --> 00:58:51,912
Do your job right,
nobody should notice.

1306
00:58:51,955 --> 00:58:54,737
When you fuck up,
everything gets full of shit.

1307
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:56,429
...symbol of
the military team...

1308
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:59,314
Sergeant William Schumann,
the "Old Shoe."

1309
00:58:59,347 --> 00:59:01,900
Let's line up the president
for the Peace Prize.

1310
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,761
Our job ends on election day.

1311
00:59:03,795 --> 00:59:05,453
Come on.

1312
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:08,525
Just for the symmetry
of the thing?

1313
00:59:08,563 --> 00:59:09,773
That's right.

1314
00:59:09,811 --> 00:59:11,502
lf Kissinger can win
the Peace Prize...

1315
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:14,670
l wouldn't be surprised
if l'd won the Preakness.

1316
00:59:14,707 --> 00:59:18,089
But our guy did bring peace.

1317
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,592
But there wasn't a war.

1318
00:59:19,635 --> 00:59:22,090
All the greater accomplishment.

1319
00:59:38,515 --> 00:59:40,882
Where's the money--

1320
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:43,597
where's the tie-in
with throwing away shoes?

1321
00:59:43,635 --> 00:59:45,260
Who pays you for that?

1322
00:59:45,299 --> 00:59:47,535
You throw away shoes.
What are you gonna do?

1323
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:48,978
Buy new ones.

1324
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:51,115
We have some powerful
new friends...

1325
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:53,969
at the lnternational Association
of Shoe Manufacturers.

1326
00:59:54,002 --> 00:59:55,595
You guys sure get around.

1327
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,674
Fad King is my hero.
Want to go first?

1328
00:59:57,714 --> 00:59:59,405
Sure.

1329
00:59:59,443 --> 01:00:01,898
Attaboy.

1330
01:00:01,938 --> 01:00:03,531
History, Connie.

1331
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:06,855
Those are ratty shoes.

1332
01:00:06,898 --> 01:00:09,037
That's why
we're flinging them away.

1333
01:00:09,074 --> 01:00:11,944
You want to try some?
Go ahead.

1334
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:13,547
Attaboy.

1335
01:00:13,586 --> 01:00:15,375
Do it again.

1336
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,101
Go ahead. Have a ball.

1337
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:22,570
Watch this.

1338
01:00:25,682 --> 01:00:27,176
Go on, tell your friends.

1339
01:00:29,714 --> 01:00:31,470
This is interesting.

1340
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:35,215
l have just been handed this.
Something just discovered.

1341
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,795
A 1930s recording, part of
the folk song collection...

1342
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:40,295
of the Library of Congress...

1343
01:00:40,338 --> 01:00:43,567
and a fitting song,
if l may say so, about Shoe.

1344
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:45,326
Schumann
is the military soldier...

1345
01:00:45,362 --> 01:00:47,184
who's been left behind
enemy lines...

1346
01:00:55,441 --> 01:00:57,197
Jim, can l get a word with you?

1347
01:00:57,234 --> 01:00:59,241
Would you like to comment
on Albania?

1348
01:01:00,818 --> 01:01:03,054
There is one thing
l'd like to say.

1349
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:06,832
This is to the Albanians
that have this man.

1350
01:01:06,865 --> 01:01:10,029
l mean this from the bottom
of my heart as one of your race.

1351
01:01:12,914 --> 01:01:15,019
l didn't know Jim Belushi
was Albanian.

1352
01:01:21,202 --> 01:01:22,958
The search
for Willie Schumann continues...

1353
01:01:51,697 --> 01:01:53,999
As soon as we land,
l want a reflexologist.

1354
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:55,244
Male or female?

1355
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:56,841
The White House
wants to know about...

1356
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:58,091
the Congressional Medal
of Honor.

1357
01:01:58,129 --> 01:01:59,624
-What about it?
-For Schumann.

1358
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:02,153
Wait a minute.
We got 86% in favor.

1359
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:05,324
We bring him back tomorrow,
charts don't go down.

1360
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:06,888
l don't want to tell them
how to do their business...

1361
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:08,336
but why don't they do it
after the election?

1362
01:02:08,369 --> 01:02:10,508
Makes more sense,
and it'll help them more.

1363
01:02:10,545 --> 01:02:12,487
When are you bringing him back?

1364
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:14,417
King, show him the thing.

1365
01:02:14,449 --> 01:02:17,166
-lt's not done yet.
-Show it to him.

1366
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:20,681
Talk about enlarging the market.
Tell him.

1367
01:02:20,721 --> 01:02:23,143
Here it is. Artist's rendering
of the memorial.

1368
01:02:23,185 --> 01:02:24,461
The memorial?

1369
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:26,952
That's the memorial
of the fallen.

1370
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:28,301
Of the Albanian campaign.

1371
01:02:28,337 --> 01:02:30,279
-Lovely.
-lt's better than lovely.

1372
01:02:30,321 --> 01:02:32,296
This guy made a deal
with Governor Kneehigh--

1373
01:02:32,337 --> 01:02:33,930
Senator Leahy.

1374
01:02:33,968 --> 01:02:36,390
You should see the granite
you have to put in this thing.

1375
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:38,288
Got a site picked out
and everything.

1376
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,208
The beauty part is...

1377
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,063
guess who retains
the merchandising rights.

1378
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:43,690
Show him the clock?

1379
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:45,419
Got it as a clock.

1380
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:47,050
Lovely.

1381
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:49,161
-Let's go.
-When's Schumann coming back?

1382
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:50,445
Getting him right now.

1383
01:02:50,481 --> 01:02:52,783
l need his neck size.

1384
01:02:52,816 --> 01:02:54,026
l think it's 17 1/2.

1385
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:56,170
Thinking 17 1/2
is not good enough.

1386
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:58,696
l'm an artist,
not a factory worker.

1387
01:02:58,736 --> 01:03:00,776
What did he eat
behind enemy lines?

1388
01:03:00,816 --> 01:03:02,343
Birds, snakes.

1389
01:03:02,384 --> 01:03:05,232
Bullshit. He ate
tiny cheeseburgers in tin foil.

1390
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:06,606
Pull a string,
they heat themselves.

1391
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:08,528
We call Burger King,
Johnny Rockets.

1392
01:03:08,561 --> 01:03:10,927
We get the Shoe Burger
with cheese and 303 sauce...

1393
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,546
"Behind enemy lines or anytime."

1394
01:03:13,584 --> 01:03:14,991
That's the slogan.

1395
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:17,741
l got the copyright
on the Albanian kitten thing.

1396
01:03:17,776 --> 01:03:19,816
l'm gonna call Nike,
get Rodman to dye his hair.

1397
01:03:19,856 --> 01:03:21,678
We'll have a sneaker--
"Air Leopard."

1398
01:03:25,297 --> 01:03:26,987
...a high school
basketball game last night...

1399
01:03:27,024 --> 01:03:29,609
between Montgomery Bell
and Blair Park.

1400
01:03:29,648 --> 01:03:31,055
Students, during the game...

1401
01:03:31,088 --> 01:03:33,609
in spontaneous moment
of sheer patriotism...

1402
01:03:33,648 --> 01:03:36,779
threw their tennis shoes
on the court by the hundreds,

1403
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,278
just for the Old Shoe.

1404
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,971
Bring him back.
William Schumann...

1405
01:03:41,008 --> 01:03:42,896
There's no business like it.

1406
01:03:42,928 --> 01:03:45,416
Demonstrations are springing up
all over the country...

1407
01:03:45,456 --> 01:03:48,075
as Americans
show their patriotism.

1408
01:03:48,112 --> 01:03:51,178
You ought to get them to run
that inaugural speech by me.

1409
01:03:51,216 --> 01:03:53,039
lnaugural speech?
l don't know.

1410
01:03:53,072 --> 01:03:55,309
The White House staff
won't give up that one.

1411
01:03:55,344 --> 01:03:59,206
Come on. Let me close out
the thing in style.

1412
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:01,256
l've come to feel it's my thing.

1413
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:04,645
You take a job, and many times,
it's just a job...

1414
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,137
Hell of a ride.

1415
01:04:08,176 --> 01:04:09,670
lsn't it?

1416
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:11,205
You take the bitter
with the sweet...

1417
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:12,873
or the sweet with the bitter.

1418
01:04:12,912 --> 01:04:14,155
What's that expression?

1419
01:04:17,295 --> 01:04:20,557
...feeling good
about the economy.

1420
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:22,446
That's why we're voting
for the president, Ed.

1421
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,724
What do you think?

1422
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:27,982
Bob, my mind wasn't
100% made up, but now it is.

1423
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:31,528
Don't go changing horses
in midstream.

1424
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,665
Absolutely.

1425
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,486
Who needs surprises these days?

1426
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:38,948
For an economy
you can rely on...

1427
01:04:38,991 --> 01:04:40,682
Fucking amateurs.

1428
01:04:42,288 --> 01:04:45,670
Pity of it is, two more days,
and we bring it back home.

1429
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:46,759
Knock wood.

1430
01:04:47,504 --> 01:04:48,933
Who's gonna know?

1431
01:04:49,743 --> 01:04:51,653
Who's gonna know what we did?

1432
01:04:52,879 --> 01:04:54,373
Pride of a job well done, Stan.

1433
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:57,514
lt's the pride of a job
well done, but it's more.

1434
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,989
lt's the gratitude of your party
and your president, right?

1435
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,188
-ls that the thing?
-lndeed it is.

1436
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:10,375
Dean City, Oklahoma.
Army special programs.

1437
01:05:10,415 --> 01:05:12,041
Tell 'em to bring
Schumann to the plane.

1438
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,413
We'll bring him back
and stash him in the hospital.

1439
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:17,414
Call the plane.
Tell me where to pick him up.

1440
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,397
l bet you're good at chess.

1441
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,980
l would be, l could remember
how all the pieces move.

1442
01:05:23,631 --> 01:05:24,972
We'll call you.

1443
01:05:26,031 --> 01:05:30,766
l'll do the same
in His great name...

1444
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,647
if you have courage, Mom.

1445
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:38,728
l can always feel your love.

1446
01:05:40,015 --> 01:05:42,600
Send, and l'll receive.

1447
01:05:44,654 --> 01:05:47,021
Units of 303,
the Defense Department...

1448
01:05:47,055 --> 01:05:48,997
confirmed early this morning,
Albanian time...

1449
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,716
stormed the mountain hideaway
near the city of...

1450
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:55,533
freeing a tired but happy
William Schumann.

1451
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:57,705
A high White House source
confirms...

1452
01:05:57,742 --> 01:06:00,328
that he's expected
in Washington tomorrow morning.

1453
01:06:00,366 --> 01:06:01,576
How's that?

1454
01:06:08,143 --> 01:06:09,932
When we touch down tomorrow...

1455
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,526
Big Bird meets Schumann
at the airport?

1456
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:14,250
Big mistake. You got to bring
him in by stages.

1457
01:06:14,287 --> 01:06:17,069
Big mistake to reveal
Schumann before the election.

1458
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:18,313
How so?

1459
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,838
Sweetheart,
Schumann is the shark.

1460
01:06:20,878 --> 01:06:22,765
Schumann is Jaws.

1461
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:25,100
You have to tease 'em.

1462
01:06:25,134 --> 01:06:28,331
You don't put Jaws
in the first reel of the movie.

1463
01:06:28,366 --> 01:06:30,253
lt's the contract, sweetheart.

1464
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,969
The contract with the election,
whether they know it or not...

1465
01:06:33,006 --> 01:06:34,893
is vote for me Tuesday...

1466
01:06:34,926 --> 01:06:37,097
Wednesday,
l will produce Schumann.

1467
01:06:37,134 --> 01:06:39,174
That's what they're paying
their seven bucks for.

1468
01:06:39,215 --> 01:06:40,709
Know what l mean?

1469
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,441
Whatever.

1470
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:43,885
Everybody's gotta learn.

1471
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:45,379
Any business.

1472
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,520
You take the fruit
of 40 years...

1473
01:06:48,558 --> 01:06:50,730
hard lessons, mistakes,
and you call it wisdom.

1474
01:06:50,766 --> 01:06:51,944
That's the truth.

1475
01:06:51,982 --> 01:06:54,316
End of the day,
just when you know something...

1476
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:55,844
time to go home.

1477
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:58,058
You got decades in you now.

1478
01:06:58,094 --> 01:07:00,134
You got decades left in you.

1479
01:07:00,174 --> 01:07:01,287
Yeah, but...

1480
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,587
What could l do to top this?

1481
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:09,963
The 37th Psalm.

1482
01:07:09,998 --> 01:07:14,504
l'll do the same
in His great name...

1483
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:17,225
if you have courage, Mom.

1484
01:07:17,262 --> 01:07:19,979
You see her?
That was real tears.

1485
01:07:20,014 --> 01:07:22,152
We were gonna give her
those drops.

1486
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,230
-She cried.
-Really?

1487
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,604
-She cried real.
-lt looks it.

1488
01:07:26,638 --> 01:07:29,005
Pray for me...

1489
01:07:29,037 --> 01:07:31,274
and the USA.

1490
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:34,571
Pray they never use the bomb.

1491
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:38,342
What are you going
to do after this?

1492
01:07:38,382 --> 01:07:39,942
They owe you big.

1493
01:07:39,982 --> 01:07:42,316
Ambassador to this or that,
whatever.

1494
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,756
Ambassador to what?

1495
01:07:43,789 --> 01:07:45,545
l don't even like to go
to Brentwood.

1496
01:07:48,014 --> 01:07:49,956
That's what l want.

1497
01:07:49,998 --> 01:07:51,405
That's my reward.

1498
01:07:51,437 --> 01:07:52,615
That's the payoff.

1499
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:54,857
You want to go to the lnaugural?

1500
01:07:54,894 --> 01:07:57,479
Might if l was asked.

1501
01:08:18,446 --> 01:08:20,998
This here, Schumann and us...

1502
01:08:21,037 --> 01:08:23,371
Look at that.
King Kong and the trainers.

1503
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:25,259
This is it.

1504
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,154
l'm standing with this picture
of Sergeant Willie Schumann.

1505
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:33,833
He's become known to Americans
simply as the Old Shoe...

1506
01:08:33,869 --> 01:08:35,876
This is gonna be a masterpiece.

1507
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:37,641
Giving them what they want.

1508
01:08:37,677 --> 01:08:41,125
...his Group 303 and left behind
in enemy territory.

1509
01:08:41,165 --> 01:08:43,532
Here at
Andrews Air Force Base...

1510
01:08:43,564 --> 01:08:45,320
they prepare for the return
of Willie Schumann.

1511
01:08:52,173 --> 01:08:55,402
Sergeant Schumann, if l may,
welcome to history.

1512
01:08:55,436 --> 01:08:57,160
Sergeant Schumann, l'm Ames.

1513
01:08:57,197 --> 01:08:58,790
Somebody named Brean?

1514
01:08:58,828 --> 01:09:00,235
Right here.

1515
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,894
Sign here for me.

1516
01:09:03,501 --> 01:09:05,737
Captain,
you want to take her up?

1517
01:09:05,773 --> 01:09:07,114
There's heavy weather back east.

1518
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:08,393
What do you think?

1519
01:09:08,428 --> 01:09:10,850
6 to 5 and pick 'em.
You want to chance it?

1520
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:12,933
lf it'll fly, let's fly.
People are waiting.

1521
01:09:18,444 --> 01:09:20,681
A child at the airport
breaks through the ranks...

1522
01:09:20,716 --> 01:09:24,361
runs to Old Shoe,
rubs meat on Schumann's cuff.

1523
01:09:24,396 --> 01:09:26,851
A little dog runs to it.
The dog loves Schumann.

1524
01:09:26,893 --> 01:09:29,162
He is a perfect war hero.

1525
01:09:29,196 --> 01:09:30,538
Perfect.

1526
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:32,361
You cast him.

1527
01:09:32,396 --> 01:09:33,989
All right. Book it up.

1528
01:09:37,068 --> 01:09:38,410
What's this?

1529
01:09:38,444 --> 01:09:40,070
Keys to the manacles.

1530
01:09:43,181 --> 01:09:44,937
Oh, my God.

1531
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,794
Wait.

1532
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,709
What is the trouble?

1533
01:09:56,748 --> 01:09:59,137
No trouble at all, ma'am.

1534
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,969
Then why is he in chains?

1535
01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:03,874
He's in chains
because he's a convict.

1536
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:06,278
A convict?

1537
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:11,683
How you doing?

1538
01:10:25,036 --> 01:10:26,181
Take a look.

1539
01:10:31,276 --> 01:10:33,927
When we asked
for special programs...

1540
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,589
they gave us special prisons.

1541
01:10:35,627 --> 01:10:37,634
Only a one-word difference.

1542
01:10:37,676 --> 01:10:40,294
-Has he been in jail long?
-12 years.

1543
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:41,673
Does he have much longer
to serve?

1544
01:10:43,692 --> 01:10:44,837
What did he do?

1545
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,566
He raped a nun.

1546
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,762
-And...
-l don't want to know an "and."

1547
01:10:50,795 --> 01:10:51,723
Why is there an "and"?

1548
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:55,749
He's fine as long
as he gets his medications.

1549
01:10:55,787 --> 01:10:57,642
And if he doesn't?

1550
01:10:57,675 --> 01:10:58,919
He's not fine.

1551
01:11:02,027 --> 01:11:03,402
Up there, Captain.

1552
01:11:05,259 --> 01:11:06,950
You'd better get us
to Washington.

1553
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:13,446
How are ya?

1554
01:11:15,243 --> 01:11:16,672
Fine.

1555
01:11:26,379 --> 01:11:27,841
Gonna get me back tomorrow?

1556
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:31,298
'Cause, you know, tomorrow
they're having beans.

1557
01:11:31,339 --> 01:11:33,761
l need a readjustment.
We have to rethink this.

1558
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:35,145
Beans!

1559
01:11:35,179 --> 01:11:37,034
We're trying to do this thing.

1560
01:11:37,067 --> 01:11:40,362
As long as you
get me back for the beans.

1561
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:42,337
He's sicker than we thought.

1562
01:11:42,379 --> 01:11:45,859
Rush him under wraps
to Walter Reed for tests.

1563
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:48,965
lf you're gonna keep me out,
l'd like to go to church.

1564
01:11:49,003 --> 01:11:50,344
You know what l mean?

1565
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:53,575
Are you very religious?

1566
01:11:57,834 --> 01:11:59,493
What have you done to me?

1567
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:04,801
All combat takes place
at night in the rain...

1568
01:12:04,843 --> 01:12:06,305
at the junction
of four map segments.

1569
01:12:06,347 --> 01:12:07,688
What are you going to do?

1570
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,610
He's fine as long
as he gets his medication.

1571
01:12:09,643 --> 01:12:13,440
Speaking of that,
we're gonna need lots of this.

1572
01:12:13,483 --> 01:12:15,239
Get on the phone and get it.

1573
01:12:15,274 --> 01:12:17,795
You people are looking
at this wrong.

1574
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:19,722
lf you look at the back story...

1575
01:12:19,755 --> 01:12:21,762
the guy is coming back
from combat and torture...

1576
01:12:21,802 --> 01:12:23,657
of course he's going to be
a little fucked up.

1577
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:26,249
He's gonna need help.

1578
01:12:26,282 --> 01:12:29,730
Anybody want a beer?
'Cause l could party.

1579
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,559
l'm gonna need an ambulance.

1580
01:12:31,594 --> 01:12:33,285
We take him the last moment
from the plane.

1581
01:12:33,322 --> 01:12:37,032
We land, take him
from the plane to the ambulance.

1582
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:40,034
Air Force jet lands, we take
somebody else from that jet.

1583
01:12:40,074 --> 01:12:42,179
What the fuck do l care?

1584
01:12:42,218 --> 01:12:43,712
Somebody in a hospital gown.

1585
01:12:43,755 --> 01:12:45,348
You get me back for the beans.

1586
01:12:45,386 --> 01:12:46,793
'Cause tomorrow's the beans.

1587
01:12:46,826 --> 01:12:48,353
'Cause this dog
ain't gonna hunt.

1588
01:12:48,394 --> 01:12:50,696
He's gonna be fine.

1589
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:51,941
Aren't you, William?

1590
01:12:51,978 --> 01:12:54,400
Speaking of which,
l have a prescription here.

1591
01:12:54,442 --> 01:12:56,679
l want you standing by
with a lot of this stuff.

1592
01:12:56,714 --> 01:12:58,503
A crate of it. lt's...

1593
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,926
Anti-psychotic.

1594
01:13:02,762 --> 01:13:04,288
The number is V--

1595
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:07,493
This is nothing.

1596
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,439
l used to think
l was a pharmacist...

1597
01:13:09,482 --> 01:13:10,758
the stuff l carried.

1598
01:13:10,794 --> 01:13:14,209
With the beans, you can tell
if they're puttin' stuff in it.

1599
01:13:15,722 --> 01:13:17,959
So you don't have to fear it.

1600
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:20,552
What kind of stuff?

1601
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:25,412
What do you mean,
what kind of stuff?

1602
01:13:28,202 --> 01:13:30,623
He just wanted to know
what you meant.

1603
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:32,073
Did you mean?

1604
01:13:32,106 --> 01:13:34,146
-l didn't.
-He didn't mean.

1605
01:13:34,185 --> 01:13:36,520
-He didn't mean anything.
-You meant something.

1606
01:13:36,554 --> 01:13:37,732
He didn't mean anything.

1607
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:39,297
Give him another pill.

1608
01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:43,015
What the fuck do you mean,
what kind of stuff?

1609
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,122
Pill, William.

1610
01:13:45,513 --> 01:13:48,296
This is nothing.
Did you ever shoot in ltaly?

1611
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:51,527
Try three starlets swacked-out
on Benzedrine and grappa.

1612
01:13:51,562 --> 01:13:53,417
This is nothing.

1613
01:13:53,449 --> 01:13:55,457
This is a walk in the park.

1614
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:59,206
Who are you?

1615
01:13:59,242 --> 01:14:00,900
Who are you sons of bitches?

1616
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:03,393
-Killers!
-Just calm down.

1617
01:14:03,434 --> 01:14:05,157
Where are you taking me?

1618
01:14:09,065 --> 01:14:10,342
Oh, my God!

1619
01:14:14,313 --> 01:14:16,255
Sergeant Willie Schumann
is coming home.

1620
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:18,686
Schumann's plane should be
over the Atlantic Ocean...

1621
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:21,348
making its final descent
back into this country.

1622
01:14:21,385 --> 01:14:22,629
The White House reported...

1623
01:14:22,665 --> 01:14:25,731
he was safely rescued
and on his way to American soil.

1624
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,657
We're still waiting
for his plane...

1625
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:29,184
at Andrews Air Force Base.

1626
01:14:29,225 --> 01:14:32,356
A plane that is due to land.
Long overdue.

1627
01:14:32,393 --> 01:14:35,011
The president is monitoring
the situation...

1628
01:14:35,049 --> 01:14:36,937
personally and closely.

1629
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:39,206
We will keep you updated
as to any developments.

1630
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:40,485
Thank you very much.

1631
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:42,910
Oh, God.
What do we do now?

1632
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:46,113
What do we do now, boy producer?

1633
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:48,574
Mister win-an-Emmy,
social-conscience, whale-shit...

1634
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,951
save-the-rain-forest,
peacenik-commie...

1635
01:14:50,985 --> 01:14:53,123
fuckin'-hire-a-convict shithead?

1636
01:14:53,161 --> 01:14:56,324
What do we do now, liberal,
affirmative action, shithead...

1637
01:14:56,361 --> 01:14:57,954
peacenik commie fuck?

1638
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:02,595
This is nothing.
Piece of cake.

1639
01:15:02,633 --> 01:15:05,251
Producing
is being a samurai warrior.

1640
01:15:05,288 --> 01:15:06,914
They pay you day in,
day out for years...

1641
01:15:06,952 --> 01:15:09,505
so that one day,
when called upon...

1642
01:15:09,545 --> 01:15:12,392
you can respond,
your training at its peak...

1643
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:13,985
and save the day!

1644
01:15:17,641 --> 01:15:19,234
Produce this Schumann.

1645
01:15:19,273 --> 01:15:20,866
Produce him, l say...

1646
01:15:20,904 --> 01:15:22,366
or, and l don't hesitate
to say this...

1647
01:15:22,409 --> 01:15:26,686
rank him as just another
in a series of broken promises.

1648
01:15:26,729 --> 01:15:30,373
This tardy absence of the flight
must give us pause...

1649
01:15:30,408 --> 01:15:34,751
and in that pause, we should
take time to examine ourselves--

1650
01:15:34,792 --> 01:15:36,166
Fuck you.

1651
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:38,273
Leave it alone.
What did television do to you?

1652
01:15:38,313 --> 01:15:40,833
lt destroyed
the electoral process.

1653
01:15:40,872 --> 01:15:43,840
Enough lovemaking.
Let's go. Come on.

1654
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:46,881
-Where?
-We got work to do.

1655
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,327
Come on, pal.

1656
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,767
ls it time for exercise?

1657
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,709
lt's my day in the yard.

1658
01:15:51,753 --> 01:15:53,411
Let's get him to the highway.

1659
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,750
Think this is tough?
Come on, pal!

1660
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:58,021
This is nothing! Piece of cake!

1661
01:15:58,056 --> 01:15:59,682
Albanian dissidents...

1662
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,470
having somehow obtained
a surface-to-air missile...

1663
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:04,871
You had your fortune here.

1664
01:16:04,904 --> 01:16:06,758
You were ready to throw it away.

1665
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:09,923
lf you got a problem, solve it.
That's producing.

1666
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,124
Someday when they
tell this story--

1667
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,567
You can't tell this story.

1668
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,989
-Why not?
-Somebody would have you killed.

1669
01:16:17,032 --> 01:16:19,333
Of course, l know.

1670
01:16:19,368 --> 01:16:23,012
Not now. But when
they do tell the story--

1671
01:16:23,048 --> 01:16:26,047
Nobody can tell this story,
ever.

1672
01:16:27,464 --> 01:16:30,530
Listen to me.
This is what l do for a living.

1673
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,472
You can't tell this story.
He's not kidding you.

1674
01:16:33,512 --> 01:16:35,551
You can't tell this story.
You knew that.

1675
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:37,599
The deal was you get
an ambassadorship.

1676
01:16:38,856 --> 01:16:40,831
l used to have a Camaro.

1677
01:16:40,872 --> 01:16:43,360
What are you going to tell?
The guy's a nut case.

1678
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,505
You would be too if you went
through what he went through.

1679
01:16:45,544 --> 01:16:46,951
He raped a nun.

1680
01:16:46,984 --> 01:16:48,162
What he went through in Albania.

1681
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,477
He's doped to the gills.

1682
01:16:49,512 --> 01:16:50,821
Where's my little pills?

1683
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,033
Show some compassion.

1684
01:16:52,072 --> 01:16:54,276
He spent the last 12 years
in a military prison.

1685
01:16:54,312 --> 01:16:56,385
How are we gonna explain that?

1686
01:16:56,424 --> 01:16:58,693
Explain it? Am l worried?

1687
01:16:58,727 --> 01:17:00,550
How do we explain that
when the world is watching?

1688
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,950
Fuck the world.
Try a 10 a.m. pitch meeting...

1689
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:05,350
coked to the gills, and you
haven't read the treatment.

1690
01:17:05,383 --> 01:17:07,325
How do we explain
he was in prison?

1691
01:17:08,392 --> 01:17:09,701
Well, you see, Winifred...

1692
01:17:09,735 --> 01:17:11,939
this is where
you've never been at a pitch.

1693
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:13,317
His records say he was
in prison...

1694
01:17:13,352 --> 01:17:16,385
as they say for all the men
and women of Group 303...

1695
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:20,002
as they must
because of the secrecy involved.

1696
01:17:37,063 --> 01:17:38,437
l'm on top of it.

1697
01:17:38,472 --> 01:17:40,414
Not sure whether enemy action...

1698
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:41,862
l'm fine. l got it.

1699
01:17:43,335 --> 01:17:45,920
Stanley, l told you,
l do this for a living.

1700
01:17:45,959 --> 01:17:47,519
You do what for a living?

1701
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:49,120
Exactly what do you do
for the president?

1702
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:51,395
l lost my wallet.
You got any change?

1703
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:54,941
How we doing, boy?

1704
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:56,445
Ready to mix it up?

1705
01:17:56,487 --> 01:17:58,243
ls today laundry day?

1706
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:01,127
-What do you do on laundry day?
-Laundry.

1707
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:03,712
Stand by to copy this.
Just get a pencil.

1708
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:05,158
Down safely.

1709
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:07,231
Produce this Schumann.

1710
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:10,468
Produce him, l say, or, and
l don't hesitate to say this...

1711
01:18:10,503 --> 01:18:14,464
rank him as just another
in a series of broken promises.

1712
01:18:14,502 --> 01:18:15,909
Sustained minor injuries.

1713
01:18:15,943 --> 01:18:18,245
Flight crew being investigated
for possible pilot error.

1714
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:20,221
Transshipped
to an undisclosed location.

1715
01:18:21,703 --> 01:18:24,867
This deserted runway should be
filled with well-wishers.

1716
01:18:24,903 --> 01:18:28,067
How you doing?
A cold drink?

1717
01:18:28,102 --> 01:18:30,491
Schumann was to return
to American soil today...

1718
01:18:30,534 --> 01:18:32,477
after his safe rescue
in Albania.

1719
01:18:33,287 --> 01:18:35,426
He looks like me.

1720
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:39,581
...deserves an explanation
from the White House.

1721
01:18:39,622 --> 01:18:43,616
Wait, we are now going
live to the White House.

1722
01:18:43,655 --> 01:18:46,022
l have an update regarding
the aircraft incident...

1723
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,647
involving Sergeant Schumann.

1724
01:18:47,687 --> 01:18:50,272
He is down safely
and will be transshipped.

1725
01:18:50,311 --> 01:18:52,961
We are informed he has sustained
minor injuries...

1726
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:54,755
which will require his being
medicated for some time...

1727
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,798
Bring in the cavalry.
Nick of time.

1728
01:18:59,142 --> 01:19:00,833
Political shitbirds.
Fuck with us, huh?

1729
01:19:00,871 --> 01:19:02,397
They don't know
who they're playing with.

1730
01:19:07,302 --> 01:19:08,578
Purty.

1731
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,101
l'm a little concerned
about the driver of the rig.

1732
01:19:12,134 --> 01:19:13,563
-What rig?
-The harvester.

1733
01:19:13,606 --> 01:19:16,509
-What about him?
-He doesn't have his green card.

1734
01:19:21,222 --> 01:19:22,716
So what?

1735
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:26,206
You want Schumann to be
rescued by an illegal alien?

1736
01:19:26,247 --> 01:19:29,181
We can't have Schumann saved
by an illegal immigrant.

1737
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:31,110
Get on the phone.
Fly in a judge.

1738
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:33,531
Get on the phone.
What's all this moping about?

1739
01:19:39,494 --> 01:19:41,087
Do you have any change?

1740
01:19:43,014 --> 01:19:46,243
l like the night life,
l like to boogie.

1741
01:19:48,358 --> 01:19:49,438
Susie!

1742
01:19:49,478 --> 01:19:50,755
William?

1743
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:52,546
Are you all right?

1744
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:57,731
Kickball.

1745
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:06,043
Let me talk to him !

1746
01:20:06,086 --> 01:20:07,492
What are you doing?

1747
01:20:07,526 --> 01:20:08,835
l think we should--

1748
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:12,066
Willie, where are you going?

1749
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,693
Shoester!

1750
01:20:19,301 --> 01:20:22,650
Let me talk to him.
Shoe, you in there?

1751
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,864
l'll kill that son of a bitch.

1752
01:20:24,902 --> 01:20:27,749
l have a relationship.
You want to talk?

1753
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:30,203
Get you anything you want.
You want some beans?

1754
01:20:30,246 --> 01:20:31,489
Will that do it, Shoester?

1755
01:20:33,765 --> 01:20:35,074
Come on, Shoe!

1756
01:20:37,157 --> 01:20:39,164
He's dead.

1757
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:48,479
Wait a minute.

1758
01:20:48,517 --> 01:20:50,622
He's not dead. He's alive.

1759
01:20:51,877 --> 01:20:53,186
Strike that.

1760
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:01,531
So close and yet so far.

1761
01:21:01,573 --> 01:21:02,817
What do you mean?

1762
01:21:02,854 --> 01:21:04,195
We were this close.

1763
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:06,400
This is nothing.

1764
01:21:06,437 --> 01:21:07,615
This just got big.

1765
01:21:07,653 --> 01:21:09,563
Big? He's dead.

1766
01:21:09,605 --> 01:21:10,914
We killed Old Shoe.

1767
01:21:12,261 --> 01:21:15,043
What is better
than the triumphal homecoming...

1768
01:21:15,077 --> 01:21:16,703
of a war hero?

1769
01:21:22,885 --> 01:21:23,965
Ready!

1770
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:25,789
Lift!

1771
01:21:25,829 --> 01:21:27,869
We're gathered here...

1772
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:31,332
with a cross to bear.

1773
01:21:31,365 --> 01:21:33,437
The bravest men...

1774
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:36,672
anywhere.

1775
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:39,482
That this great land...

1776
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:43,005
will remain free.

1777
01:21:43,045 --> 01:21:44,638
God bless the men...

1778
01:21:44,677 --> 01:21:48,386
of the 303.

1779
01:21:48,933 --> 01:21:51,453
Side by side...

1780
01:21:51,493 --> 01:21:54,340
we know no fear.

1781
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:57,220
Our minds are sharp.

1782
01:21:57,253 --> 01:22:00,067
Our eyes are clear.

1783
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:03,002
ln the air, on land...

1784
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:05,761
or on the sea...

1785
01:22:05,797 --> 01:22:07,935
we're the fightin' men...

1786
01:22:07,973 --> 01:22:11,420
of the 303.

1787
01:22:14,532 --> 01:22:17,249
Give us this day...

1788
01:22:17,284 --> 01:22:20,219
our daily bread...

1789
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:22,464
and leopard skin...

1790
01:22:23,428 --> 01:22:25,949
for our head.

1791
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:27,995
That we may fight...

1792
01:22:35,844 --> 01:22:37,022
Coffee?

1793
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,402
Please.

1794
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:40,444
Looking good.

1795
01:22:40,484 --> 01:22:42,589
Bring it all back home.

1796
01:22:42,628 --> 01:22:45,181
Lassie barks twice, and it's
time to take out the garbage.

1797
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,714
Hell of a show.

1798
01:22:46,756 --> 01:22:48,098
Hell of a job.

1799
01:22:48,132 --> 01:22:49,725
lt's just producing.

1800
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:52,634
There's no Academy Award
for producing.

1801
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:53,952
You're kidding.

1802
01:22:55,172 --> 01:22:57,409
Where do movies come from
if nobody produces them?

1803
01:22:58,659 --> 01:23:00,318
They come from people like you.

1804
01:23:03,748 --> 01:23:05,471
You just got to take
the bitter with the better.

1805
01:23:05,508 --> 01:23:07,897
Job's almost done--

1806
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,052
knock on wood.

1807
01:23:09,987 --> 01:23:11,231
We did a good job.

1808
01:23:11,268 --> 01:23:12,512
That's our reward.

1809
01:23:14,019 --> 01:23:15,645
You can't save the world.

1810
01:23:15,684 --> 01:23:16,961
All you can do is try.

1811
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:19,296
Ain't that the truth?

1812
01:23:24,643 --> 01:23:26,302
As we said, the president--

1813
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,893
thrust of the Albanian episode
to put him over the top.

1814
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:31,898
You could say that, Shirley,
but it's not true.

1815
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,249
What would be true, then?

1816
01:23:33,283 --> 01:23:35,356
You said it earlier,
if l may rephrase...

1817
01:23:35,395 --> 01:23:37,468
the success
of the president in the polls--

1818
01:23:37,508 --> 01:23:41,632
As of today, 89% favorable.

1819
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:44,122
Based not on the events...

1820
01:23:44,163 --> 01:23:46,619
but on the spin
given to those events.

1821
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:49,954
What's the lesson here?
Never give up.

1822
01:23:49,988 --> 01:23:51,165
You're right.

1823
01:23:51,204 --> 01:23:52,578
The show must go on.

1824
01:23:52,612 --> 01:23:53,789
Proud tradition.

1825
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:57,984
l am prouder of this
than anything l ever did.

1826
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,197
You should be.

1827
01:23:59,236 --> 01:24:00,642
l want to thank you.

1828
01:24:04,227 --> 01:24:05,536
You gave me a good opportunity.

1829
01:24:09,283 --> 01:24:12,317
As we said, the president,
a surefire winner...

1830
01:24:12,355 --> 01:24:15,137
and the campaign, many said,
that put him there.

1831
01:24:15,779 --> 01:24:17,721
Another great race today,
Johnny.

1832
01:24:17,763 --> 01:24:19,967
Who you going to ride
in the Stakes?

1833
01:24:20,003 --> 01:24:22,654
Eddie, like my daddy
always used to say...

1834
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:23,836
The message is irrelevant.

1835
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,784
The main element
we have to deal with...

1836
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:28,248
is that fear is
what's driving a lot of people.

1837
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:30,015
Commercials.

1838
01:24:31,395 --> 01:24:32,572
The president is a product.

1839
01:24:34,339 --> 01:24:37,121
He's the President
of the United States at 89%.

1840
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:38,780
Which we're dealing with today.

1841
01:24:38,819 --> 01:24:40,226
Commercials.

1842
01:24:41,538 --> 01:24:44,222
lt's time the American people
began to look at that.

1843
01:24:44,258 --> 01:24:47,106
Now we're going
to take your calls.

1844
01:24:47,138 --> 01:24:48,600
The number is 1-800...

1845
01:24:48,643 --> 01:24:50,748
Oh, shit.

1846
01:24:59,618 --> 01:25:01,309
Stanley, what are you doing?

1847
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:02,590
What am l doing?

1848
01:25:03,939 --> 01:25:05,531
l'm going to call somebody.

1849
01:25:06,818 --> 01:25:08,062
That's very funny.

1850
01:25:08,099 --> 01:25:09,692
l'm going to get
these people straight.

1851
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,192
You can't do that.

1852
01:25:11,235 --> 01:25:12,479
Watch me.

1853
01:25:17,026 --> 01:25:18,521
You knew the deal
when you signed on.

1854
01:25:18,563 --> 01:25:20,505
Come on. Deals change.

1855
01:25:20,546 --> 01:25:22,237
Sure it is.

1856
01:25:22,274 --> 01:25:25,176
Let's rethink
that ambassadorship.

1857
01:25:25,218 --> 01:25:27,128
l'm talking London.
l'm talking Paris.

1858
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:29,374
A secret account
for your extra expenses...

1859
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:30,785
getting laid whenever you want.

1860
01:25:30,818 --> 01:25:32,193
Marine guards will salute you.

1861
01:25:32,226 --> 01:25:34,976
lt's tempting, but l got
to answer to a higher calling.

1862
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,898
-Art.
-Money?

1863
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:38,937
You think l did this for money?

1864
01:25:38,978 --> 01:25:41,563
l did this for credit.

1865
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:42,977
You knew
you couldn't take the credit.

1866
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:44,417
l'm not going to stand here...

1867
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:46,784
and let two dickheads
from film school take it.

1868
01:25:46,818 --> 01:25:48,606
Listen to me.

1869
01:25:48,642 --> 01:25:49,820
Are you nuts?

1870
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:51,102
Stanley, no fooling.

1871
01:25:51,138 --> 01:25:52,731
You're playing with your life.

1872
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,047
Fuck my life.

1873
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:55,970
l want the credit.

1874
01:25:56,002 --> 01:25:58,424
Know what the New York Times
said about my last picture?

1875
01:25:58,466 --> 01:26:00,157
They called it
"a thrill ride for the ages..."

1876
01:26:00,194 --> 01:26:01,623
but they didn't mention
the producer.

1877
01:26:01,665 --> 01:26:03,738
They talked
about the costumes...

1878
01:26:03,778 --> 01:26:05,240
but never talked
about the producer.

1879
01:26:05,282 --> 01:26:06,460
You know what
that picture grossed?

1880
01:26:06,498 --> 01:26:07,676
Now l'm going to stand here...

1881
01:26:07,714 --> 01:26:09,787
and let some limp-dick
film-school pansy...

1882
01:26:09,826 --> 01:26:11,004
take the credit?

1883
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:12,449
You can't do it.

1884
01:26:12,481 --> 01:26:14,369
Don't you tell me that!

1885
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:16,703
Don't you ever tell me that!

1886
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:18,428
l am the producer!

1887
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:20,440
lf l didn't step up,
you're nowhere!

1888
01:26:20,482 --> 01:26:22,937
l put this together
out of spit and polish!

1889
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:24,833
Look at that.

1890
01:26:24,865 --> 01:26:27,287
That is a complete
fucking fraud...

1891
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:30,559
and it looks 100% real.

1892
01:26:36,289 --> 01:26:39,224
lt's the best work
l've ever done in my life...

1893
01:26:39,265 --> 01:26:41,370
because it's so honest.

1894
01:26:49,057 --> 01:26:50,944
They told me l couldn't
remake Moby Dick...

1895
01:26:50,977 --> 01:26:52,504
from the point of view
of the whale.

1896
01:26:52,545 --> 01:26:54,301
$450 million domestic.

1897
01:26:54,337 --> 01:26:55,744
l'm not even talking
about the video.

1898
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,817
l made this lame turkey fly.

1899
01:26:57,857 --> 01:26:59,384
l did it--pure Hollywood.

1900
01:27:00,993 --> 01:27:04,309
For once in my life,
l won't be pissed on.

1901
01:27:04,353 --> 01:27:05,499
Do you hear me?

1902
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:08,218
l want the credit.

1903
01:27:10,049 --> 01:27:11,904
l'm taking it.

1904
01:27:11,937 --> 01:27:13,563
Shit.

1905
01:27:27,393 --> 01:27:29,335
He's coming down.

1906
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:31,646
Could l see you a minute?
Thanks.

1907
01:27:35,457 --> 01:27:36,537
Do you swear to uphold...

1908
01:27:36,577 --> 01:27:37,984
the duties
and responsibilities...

1909
01:27:38,016 --> 01:27:40,635
of a citizen of
the United States of America--

1910
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:42,560
to defend her
in time of peril...

1911
01:27:42,593 --> 01:27:45,909
to defend her from all enemies,
foreign and domestic?

1912
01:27:45,952 --> 01:27:48,505
Do you make this pledge
with full resolve?

1913
01:28:05,601 --> 01:28:07,903
Common ground...

1914
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,067
and family.

1915
01:28:11,105 --> 01:28:12,512
Let's give thanks...

1916
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:16,767
to the 303.

1917
01:28:16,801 --> 01:28:19,354
Years from now...

1918
01:28:19,393 --> 01:28:22,240
when we are gone...

1919
01:28:22,273 --> 01:28:25,120
our children's kids...

1920
01:28:25,153 --> 01:28:28,382
will hear this song.

1921
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,937
Think how strong...

1922
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:34,172
and proud they'll be.

1923
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:35,517
Grandpa fought...

1924
01:28:35,553 --> 01:28:39,611
for the 303.

1925
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:42,037
God bless the men...

1926
01:28:42,081 --> 01:28:49,784
of the 303.

1927
01:28:51,008 --> 01:28:52,437
Ten-hut!

1928
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,782
Present arms!

1929
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,010
Turning to the Hollywood page...

1930
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,830
famed film producer
Stanley R. Motss...

1931
01:29:08,863 --> 01:29:11,165
died suddenly
of a massive heart attack...

1932
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,240
while sunbathing poolside.

1933
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,793
Mr. Motss
was 57 or 62-years-old...

1934
01:29:16,832 --> 01:29:18,774
depending on the bio.

1935
01:29:18,815 --> 01:29:20,920
His credits
include numerous films...

1936
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,466
which America has come
to love as old classics.

1937
01:29:29,472 --> 01:29:30,650
This just in.

1938
01:29:30,688 --> 01:29:32,990
A group calling itself
"Albania Unite..."

1939
01:29:33,023 --> 01:29:35,445
has claimed responsibility
for the bombing moments ago...

1940
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,244
of the village of Klos, Albania.

1941
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,938
The president
was unavailable for comment...

1942
01:29:38,975 --> 01:29:41,593
but General William Scott
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

1943
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,966
says he has no doubt we'll
be sending planes and troops...

1944
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,461
back in to finish the job.
